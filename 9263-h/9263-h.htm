    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the marble-floored vestibule of the Metropolitan Grand Hotel in
      Buffalo, Professor Stillson Renmark stood and looked about him with the
      anxious manner of a person unused to the gaudy splendor of the modern
      American house of entertainment. The professor had paused halfway between
      the door and the marble counter, because he began to fear that he had
      arrived at an inopportune time, that something unusual was going on. The
      hurry and bustle bewildered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An omnibus, partly filled with passengers, was standing at the door, its
      steps backed over the curbstone, and beside it was a broad, flat van, on
      which stalwart porters were heaving great square, iron-bound trunks
      belonging to commercial travelers, and the more fragile, but not less
      bulky, saratogas, doubtless the property of the ladies who sat patiently
      in the omnibus. Another vehicle which had just arrived was backing up to
      the curb, and the irate driver used language suitable to the occasion; for
      the two restive horses were not behaving exactly in the way he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man with a stentorian, but monotonous and mournful, voice was filling
      the air with the information that a train was about to depart for Albany,
      Saratoga, Troy, Boston, New York, and the East. When he came to the words
      &ldquo;the East,&rdquo; his voice dropped to a sad minor key, as if the man despaired
      of the fate of those who took their departure in that direction. Every now
      and then a brazen gong sounded sharply; and one of the negroes who sat in
      a row on a bench along the marble-paneled wall sprang forward to the
      counter, took somebody&rsquo;s handbag, and disappeared in the direction of the
      elevator with the newly arrived guest following him. Groups of men stood
      here and there conversing, heedless of the rush of arrival and departure
      around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the broad and lofty plate-glass windows sat a row of men, some
      talking, some reading, and some gazing outside, but all with their feet on
      the brass rail which had been apparently put there for that purpose.
      Nearly everybody was smoking a cigar. A lady of dignified mien came down
      the hall to the front of the counter, and spoke quietly to the clerk, who
      bent his well-groomed head deferentially on one side as he listened to
      what she had to say. The men instantly made way for her. She passed along
      among them as composedly as if she were in her own drawing room, inclining
      her head slightly to one or other of her acquaintances, which salutation
      was gravely acknowledged by the raising of the hat and the temporary
      removal of the cigar from the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was very strange to the professor, and he felt himself in a new
      world, with whose customs he was not familiar. Nobody paid the slightest
      attention to him as he stood there among it all with his satchel in his
      hand. As he timidly edged up to the counter, and tried to accumulate
      courage enough to address the clerk, a young man came forward, flung his
      handbag on the polished top of the counter, metaphorically brushed the
      professor aside, pulled the bulky register toward him, and inscribed his
      name on the page with a rapidity equaled only by the illegibility of the
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Sam!&rdquo; he said to the clerk. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s things? Get my telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the clerk; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t give you 27. It&rsquo;s been taken for a
      week. I reserved 85 for you, and had to hold on with my teeth to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply of the young man was merely a brief mention of the place of
      torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> hot,&rdquo; said the clerk blandly. &ldquo;In from Cleveland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Any letters for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couple of telegrams. You&rsquo;ll find them up in 85.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were cocksure I&rsquo;d take that room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was cocksure you&rsquo;d have to. It is that or the fifth floor. We&rsquo;re full.
      Couldn&rsquo;t give a better room to the President if he came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, what&rsquo;s good enough for the President I can put up with for a
      couple of days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand of the clerk descended on the bell. The negro sprang forward and
      took the &ldquo;grip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty-five,&rdquo; said the clerk; and the drummer and the Negro disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any place where I could leave my bag for a while?&rdquo; the professor
      at last said timidly to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor held it up in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your grip. Certainly. Have a room, sir?&rdquo; And the clerk&rsquo;s hand hovered
      over the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. At least, not just yet. You see, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. The baggage man there to the left will check it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letters for Bond?&rdquo; said a man, pushing himself in front of the
      professor. The clerk pulled out a fat bunch of letters from the
      compartment marked &ldquo;B,&rdquo; and handed the whole lot to the inquirer, who went
      rapidly over them, selected two that appeared to be addressed to him, and
      gave the letters a push toward the clerk, who placed them where they were
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor paused a moment, then, realizing that the clerk had
      forgotten him, sought the baggage man, whom he found in a room filled with
      trunks and valises. The room communicated with the great hall by means of
      a square opening whose lower ledge was breast high. The professor stood
      before it, and handed the valise to the man behind this opening, who
      rapidly attached one brass check to the handle with a leather thong, and
      flung the other piece of brass to the professor. The latter was not sure
      but there was something to pay, still he quite correctly assumed that if
      there had been the somewhat brusque man would have had no hesitation in
      mentioning the fact; in which surmise his natural common sense proved a
      sure guide among strange surroundings. There was no false delicacy about
      the baggage man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the professor was to a certain extent bewildered by the condition
      of things, there was still in his nature a certain dogged persistence that
      had before now stood him in good stead, and which had enabled him to
      distance, in the long run, much more brilliant men. He was not at all
      satisfied with his brief interview with the clerk. He resolved to approach
      that busy individual again, if he could arrest his attention. It was some
      time before he caught the speaker&rsquo;s eye, as it were, but when he did so,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to say to you that I am waiting for a friend from New York
      who may not yet have arrived. His name is Mr. Richard Yates of the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick Yates! Certainly. He&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; Turning to the negro, he said: &ldquo;Go
      down to the billiard room and see if Mr. Yates is there. If he is not,
      look for him at the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk evidently knew Mr. Dick Yates. Apparently not noticing the look
      of amazement that had stolen over the professor&rsquo;s face, the clerk said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wait in the reading room, I&rsquo;ll send Yates to you when he comes.
      The boy will find him if he&rsquo;s in the house; but he may be uptown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor, disliking to trouble the obliging clerk further, did not
      ask him where the reading room was. He inquired, instead, of a hurrying
      porter, and received the curt but comprehensive answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dining room next floor. Reading, smoking, and writing rooms up the hall.
      Billiard room, bar, and lavatory downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor, after getting into the barber shop and the cigar store,
      finally found his way into the reading room. Numerous daily papers were
      scattered around on the table, each attached to a long, clumsy cleft
      holder made of wood; while other journals, similarly encumbered, hung from
      racks against the wall. The professor sat down in one of the easy
      leather-covered chairs, but, instead of taking up a paper, drew a thin
      book from his pocket, in which he was soon so absorbed that he became
      entirely unconscious of his strange surroundings. A light touch on the
      shoulder brought him up from his book into the world again, and he saw,
      looking down on him, the stern face of a heavily mustached stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but may I ask if you are a guest of this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shade of apprehension crossed the professor&rsquo;s face as he slipped the
      book into his pocket. He had vaguely felt that he was trespassing when he
      first entered the hotel, and now his doubts were confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am not exactly a guest,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by not exactly a guest?&rdquo; continued the other, regarding
      the professor with a cold and scrutinizing gaze. &ldquo;A man is either a guest
      or he is not, I take it. Which is it in your case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume, technically speaking, I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Technically speaking! More evasions. Let me ask you, sir, as an
      ostensibly honest man, if you imagine that all this luxury&mdash;this&mdash;this
      elegance&mdash;is maintained for nothing? Do you think, sir, that it is
      provided for any man who has cheek enough to step out of the street and
      enjoy it? Is it kept up, I ask, for people who are, technically speaking,
      not guests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of conscious guilt deepened on the face of the unfortunate
      professor. He had nothing to say. He realized that his conduct was too
      flagrant to admit of defense, so he attempted none. Suddenly the
      countenance of his questioner lit up with a smile, and he smote the
      professor on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old stick-in-the-mud, you haven&rsquo;t changed a particle in fifteen
      years! You don&rsquo;t mean to pretend you don&rsquo;t know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t&mdash;you can&rsquo;t be Richard Yates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I not only can, but I can&rsquo;t be anybody else. I know, because I have often
      tried. Well, well, well, well! Stilly we used to call you; don&rsquo;t you
      remember? I&rsquo;ll never forget that time we sang &lsquo;Oft in the stilly night&rsquo; in
      front of your window when you were studying for the exams. You always <i>were</i>
      a quiet fellow, Stilly. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you nearly a whole day. I
      was up just now with a party of friends when the boy brought me your card&mdash;a
      little philanthropic gathering&mdash;sort of mutual benefit arrangement,
      you know: each of us contributed what we could spare to a general fund,
      which was given to some deserving person in the crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the professor dryly. &ldquo;I heard the clerk telling the boy where
      he would be most likely to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you did, eh?&rdquo; cried Yates, with a laugh. &ldquo;Yes, Sam generally knows
      where to send for me; but he needn&rsquo;t have been so darned public about it.
      Being a newspaper man, I know what ought to go in print and what should
      have the blue pencil run through it. Sam is very discreet, as a general
      thing; but then he knew, of course, the moment he set eyes on you, that
      you were an old pal of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Yates laughed, a very bright and cheery laugh for so evidently
      wicked a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said, taking the professor by the arm. &ldquo;We must get you
      located.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed out into the hall, and drew up at the clerk&rsquo;s counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Sam,&rdquo; cried Yates, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you do something better for us than the
      fifth floor? I didn&rsquo;t come to Buffalo to engage in ballooning. No sky
      parlors for me, if I can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Dick,&rdquo; said the clerk; &ldquo;but I expect the fifth floor will be
      gone when the Chicago express gets in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can you do for us, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can let you have 518. That&rsquo;s the next room to yours. Really, they&rsquo;re
      the most comfortable rooms in the house this weather. Fine lookout over
      the lake. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having a sight of the lake myself, if I could
      leave the desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. But I didn&rsquo;t come to look at the lake, nor yet at the railroad
      tracks this side, nor at Buffalo Creek either, beautiful and romantic as
      it is, nor to listen to the clanging of the ten thousand locomotives that
      pass within hearing distance for the delight of your guests. The fact is
      that, always excepting Chicago, Buffalo is more like&mdash;for the
      professor&rsquo;s sake I&rsquo;ll say Hades, than any other place in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Buffalo&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the clerk, with that feeling of local
      loyalty which all Americans possess. &ldquo;Say, are you here on this Fenian
      snap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Fenian snap?&rdquo; asked the newspaper man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you know about it? I thought, the moment I saw you, that you
      were here for this affair. Well, don&rsquo;t say I told you, but I can put you
      on to one of the big guns if you want the particulars. They say they&rsquo;re
      going to take Canada. I told &lsquo;em that I wouldn&rsquo;t take Canada as a gift,
      let alone fight for it. I&rsquo;ve <i>been</i> there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates&rsquo; newspaper instinct thrilled him as he thought of the possible
      sensation. Then the light slowly died out of his eyes when he looked at
      the professor, who had flushed somewhat and compressed his lips as he
      listened to the slighting remarks on his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sam,&rdquo; said the newspaper man at last, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t more than once in a
      lifetime that you&rsquo;ll find me give the go-by to a piece of news, but the
      fact is I&rsquo;m on my vacation just now. About the first I&rsquo;ve had for fifteen
      years; so, you see, I must take care of it. No, let the <i>Argus</i> get
      scooped, if it wants to. They&rsquo;ll value my services all the more when I get
      back. No. 518, I think you said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk handed over the key, and the professor gave the boy the check
      for his valise at Yates&rsquo; suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, get a move on you,&rdquo; said Yates to the elevator boy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going
      right through with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the two friends were shot up together to the fifth floor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sky parlor, as Yates had termed it, certainly commanded a very
      extensive view. Immediately underneath was a wilderness of roofs. Farther
      along were the railway tracks that Yates objected to; and a line of masts
      and propeller funnels marked the windings of Buffalo Creek, along whose
      banks arose numerous huge elevators, each marked by some tremendous letter
      of the alphabet, done in white paint against the somber brown of the big
      building. Still farther to the west was a more grateful and comforting
      sight for a hot day. The blue lake, dotted with white sails and an
      occasional trail of smoke, lay shimmering under the broiling sun. Over the
      water, through the distant summer haze, there could be seen the dim line
      of the Canadian shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit you down,&rdquo; cried Yates, putting both hands on the other&rsquo;s shoulders,
      and pushing him into a chair near the window. Then, placing his finger on
      the electric button, he added: &ldquo;What will you drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a glass of water, if it can be had without trouble,&rdquo; said
      Renmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates&rsquo; hand dropped from the electric button hopelessly to his side, and
      he looked reproachfully at the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;have something mild. Don&rsquo;t go rashly in for
      Buffalo water before you realize what it is made of. Work up to it
      gradually. Try a sherry cobbler or a milk shake as a starter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no. A glass of water will do very well for me. Order what you
      like for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I can be depended on for doing that.&rdquo; He pushed the button, and,
      when the boy appeared, said: &ldquo;Bring up an iced cobbler, and charge it to
      Professor Renmark, No. 518. Bring also a pitcher of ice water for Yates,
      No. 520. There,&rdquo; he continued gleefully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have all the
      drinks, except the ice water, charged to you. I&rsquo;ll pay the bill, but I&rsquo;ll
      keep the account to hold over your head in the future. Professor Stillson
      Renmark, debtor to Metropolitan Grand&mdash;one sherry cobbler, one gin
      sling, one whisky cocktail, and so on. Now, then, Stilly, let&rsquo;s talk
      business. You&rsquo;re not married, I take it, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have responded to
      my invitation so promptly.&rdquo; The professor shook his head. &ldquo;Neither am I.
      You never had the courage to propose to a girl; and I never had the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lack of self-conceit was not your failing in the old days, Richard,&rdquo; said
      Renmark quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates laughed. &ldquo;Well, it didn&rsquo;t hold me back any, to my knowledge. Now
      I&rsquo;ll tell you how I&rsquo;ve got along since we attended old Scragmore&rsquo;s academy
      together, fifteen years ago. How time does fly! When I left, I tried
      teaching for one short month. I had some theories on the education of our
      youth which did not seem to chime in with the prejudices the school
      trustees had already formed on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor was at once all attention. Touch a man on his business, and
      he generally responds by being interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what were your theories?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought a teacher should look after the physical as well as the
      mental welfare of his pupils. It did not seem to me that his duty to those
      under his charge ended with mere book learning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said the professor cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Well, the trustees didn&rsquo;t. I joined the boys at their games,
      hoping my example would have an influence on their conduct on the
      playground as well as in the schoolroom. We got up a rattling good cricket
      club. You may not remember that I stood rather better in cricket at the
      academy than I did in mathematics or grammar. By handicapping me with
      several poor players, and having the best players among the boys in
      opposition, we made a pretty evenly matched team at school section No. 12.
      One day, at noon, we began a game. The grounds were in excellent
      condition, and the opposition boys were at their best. My side was getting
      the worst of it. I was very much interested; and, when one o&rsquo;clock came, I
      thought it a pity to call school and spoil so good and interesting a
      contest. The boys were unanimously of the same opinion. The girls were
      happy, picnicking under the trees. So we played cricket all the
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that was carrying your theory a little too far,&rdquo; said the
      professor dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what the trustees thought when they came to hear of it. So they
      dismissed me; and I think my leaving was the only case on record where the
      pupils genuinely mourned a teacher&rsquo;s departure. I shook the dust of Canada
      from my feet, and have never regretted it. I tramped to Buffalo,
      continuing to shake the dust off at every step. (Hello! here&rsquo;s your drinks
      at last, Stilly. I had forgotten about them&mdash;an unusual thing with
      me. That&rsquo;s all right, boy; charge it to room 518. Ah! that hits the spot
      on a hot day.) Well, where was I? Oh, yes, at Buffalo. I got a place on a
      paper here, at just enough to keep life in me; but I liked the work. Then
      I drifted to Rochester at a bigger salary, afterward to Albany at a still
      bigger salary, and of course Albany is only a few hours from New York, and
      that is where all newspaper men ultimately land, if they are worth their
      salt. I saw a small section of the war as special correspondent, got hurt,
      and rounded up in the hospital. Since then, although only a reporter, I am
      about the top of the tree in that line, and make enough money to pay my
      poker debts and purchase iced drinks to soothe the asperities of the game.
      When there is anything big going on anywhere in the country, I am there,
      with other fellows to do the drudgery; I writing the picturesque
      descriptions and interviewing the big men. My stuff goes red-hot over the
      telegraph wire, and the humble postage stamp knows my envelopes no more. I
      am acquainted with every hotel clerk that amounts to anything from New
      York to San Francisco. If I could save money, I should be rich, for I make
      plenty; but the hole at the top of my trousers pocket has lost me a lot of
      cash, and I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get it mended. Now, you&rsquo;ve listened
      with your customary patience in order to give my self-esteem, as you
      called it, full sway. I am grateful. I will reciprocate. How about
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor spoke slowly. &ldquo;I have had no such adventurous career,&rdquo; he
      began. &ldquo;I have not shaken Canadian dust from my feet, and have not made
      any great success. I have simply plodded; and am in no danger of becoming
      rich, although I suppose I spend as little as any man. After you were
      expel&mdash;after you left the aca&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mutilate the good old English language, Stilly. You were right in
      the first place. I am not thin-skinned. You were saying after I was
      expelled. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps it might be a sore subject. You remember, you were very
      indignant at the time, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I was&mdash;and am still, for that matter. It was an outrage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was proved that you helped to put the pony in the
      principal&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. <i>That</i>. Of course. But what I detested was the way
      the principal worked the thing. He allowed that villain Spink to turn
      evidence against us, and Spink stated I originated the affair, whereas I
      could claim no such honor. It was Spink&rsquo;s own project, which I fell in
      with, as I did with every disreputable thing proposed. Of course the
      principal believed at once that I was the chief criminal. Do you happen to
      know if Spink has been hanged yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he is a very reputable business man in Montreal, and much
      respected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have suspected that. Well, you keep your eye on the respected
      Spink. If he doesn&rsquo;t fail some day, and make a lot of money, I&rsquo;m a
      Dutchman. But go on. This is digression. By the way, just push that
      electric button. You&rsquo;re nearest, and it is too hot to move. Thanks. After
      I was expelled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After your departure I took a diploma, and for a year or two taught a
      class in the academy. Then, as I studied during my spare time, I got a
      chance as master of a grammar school near Toronto, chiefly, as I think,
      though the recommendation of Principal Scragmore. I had my degree by this
      time. Then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a gentle tap at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; shouted Yates. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you. Just bring up another cooling
      cobbler, will you? and charge it, as before, to Professor Renmark, room
      518. Yes; and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then there came the opening in University College, Toronto. I had the
      good fortune to be appointed. There I am still, and there I suppose I
      shall stay. I know very few people, and am better acquainted with books
      than with men. Those whom I have the privilege of knowing are mostly
      studious persons, who have made, or will make, their mark in the world of
      learning. I have not had your advantage, of meeting statesmen who guide
      the destinies of a great empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you always were lucky, Stilly. My experience is that the chaps who do
      the guiding are more anxious about their own pockets, or their own
      political advancement, than they are of the destinies. Still, the empire
      seems to take its course westward just the same. So old Scragmore&rsquo;s been
      your friend, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he insulted me only the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You astonish me. I cannot imagine so gentlemanly and scholarly a man as
      Principal Scragmore insulting anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know him as I do. It was like this: I wanted to find out
      where you were, for reasons that I shall state hereafter. I cudgeled my
      brains, and then thought of old Scrag. I wrote him, and enclosed a stamped
      and addressed envelope, as all unsought contributors should do. He
      answered&mdash;But I have his reply somewhere. You shall read it for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates pulled from his inside pocket a bundle of letters, which he
      hurriedly fingered over, commenting in a low voice as he did so: &ldquo;I
      thought I answered that. Still, no matter. Jingo! haven&rsquo;t I paid that bill
      yet? This pass is run out. Must get another.&rdquo; Then he smiled and sighed as
      he looked at a letter in dainty handwriting; but apparently he could not
      find the document he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I have it somewhere. He returned me the
      prepaid envelope, and reminded me that United States stamps were of no use
      in Canada, which of course I should have remembered. But he didn&rsquo;t pay the
      postage on his own letter, so that I had to fork out double. Still, I
      don&rsquo;t mind that, only as an indication of his meanness. He went on to say
      that, of all the members of our class, you&mdash;<i>you</i>!&mdash;were
      the only one who had reflected credit on it. That was the insult. The idea
      of his making such a statement, when I had told him I was on the New York
      <i>Argus</i>! Credit to the class, indeed! I wonder if he ever heard of
      Brown after he was expelled. You know, of course. No? Well, Brown, by his
      own exertions, became president of the Alum Bank in New York, wrecked it,
      and got off to Canada with a clear half million. <i>Yes</i>, sir. I saw
      him in Quebec not six months ago. Keeps the finest span and carriage in
      the city, and lives in a palace. Could buy out old Scragmore a thousand
      times, and never feel it. Most liberal contributor to the cause of
      education that there is in Canada. He says education made him, and he&rsquo;s
      not a man to go back on education. And yet Scragmore has the cheek to say
      that <i>you</i> were the only man in the class who reflects credit on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor smiled quietly as the excited journalist took a cooling sip
      of the cobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Yates, people&rsquo;s opinions differ. A man like Brown may not be
      Principal Scragmore&rsquo;s ideal. The principal may be local in his ideals of a
      successful man, or of one who reflects credit on his teaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Local? You bet he&rsquo;s local. Too darned local for me. It would do that man
      good to live in New York for a year. But I&rsquo;m going to get even with him.
      I&rsquo;m going to write him up. I&rsquo;ll give him a column and a half; see if I
      don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll get his photograph, and publish a newspaper portrait of him.
      If that doesn&rsquo;t make him quake, he&rsquo;s a cast-iron man. Say, you haven&rsquo;t a
      photograph of old Scrag that you can lend me, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have; but I won&rsquo;t lend it for such a purpose. However, never mind the
      principal. Tell me your plans. I am at your disposal for a couple of
      weeks, or longer if necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy! Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you how it is. I want rest and quiet, and the
      woods, for a week or two. This is how it happened: I have been steadily at
      the grindstone, except for a while in the hospital; and that, you will
      admit, is not much of a vacation. The work interests me, and I am always
      in the thick of it. Now, it&rsquo;s like this in the newspaper business: Your
      chief is never the person to suggest that you take a vacation. He is
      usually short of men and long on things to do, so if you don&rsquo;t worry him
      into letting you off, he won&rsquo;t lose any sleep over it. He&rsquo;s content to let
      well enough alone every time. Then there is always somebody who wants to
      get away on pressing business,&mdash;grandmother&rsquo;s funeral, and that sort
      of thing,&mdash;so if a fellow is content to work right along, his chief
      is quite content to let him. That&rsquo;s the way affairs have gone for years
      with me. The other week I went over to Washington to interview a senator
      on the political prospects. I tell you what it is, Stilly, without
      bragging, there are some big men in the States whom no one but me <i>can</i>
      interview. And yet old Scrag says I&rsquo;m no credit to his class! Why, last
      year my political predictions were telegraphed all over this country, and
      have since appeared in the European press. No credit! By Jove, I would
      like to have old Scrag in a twenty-four-foot ring, with thin gloves on,
      for about ten minutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if he would shine under those circumstances. But never mind him.
      He spoke, for once, without due reflection, and with perhaps an
      exaggerated remembrance of your school-day offenses. What happened when
      you went to Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strange thing happened. When I was admitted to the senator&rsquo;s library, I
      saw another fellow, whom I thought I knew, sitting there. I said to the
      senator: &lsquo;I will come when you are alone.&rsquo; The senator looked up in
      surprise, and said: &lsquo;I am alone.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t say anything, but went on with
      my interview; and the other fellow took notes all the time. I didn&rsquo;t like
      this, but said nothing, for the senator is not a man to offend, and it is
      by not offending these fellows that I can get the information I do. Well,
      the other fellow came out with me, and as I looked at him I saw that he
      was myself. This did not strike me as strange at the time, but I argued
      with him all the way to New York, and tried to show him that he wasn&rsquo;t
      treating me fairly. I wrote up the interview, with the other fellow
      interfering all the while, so I compromised, and half the time put in what
      he suggested, and half the time what I wanted in myself. When the
      political editor went over the stuff, he looked alarmed. I told him
      frankly just how I had been interfered with, and he looked none the less
      alarmed when I had finished. He sent at once for a doctor. The doctor
      metaphorically took me to pieces, and then said to my chief: &lsquo;This man is
      simply worked to death. He must have a vacation, and a real one, with
      absolutely nothing to think of, or he is going to collapse, and that with
      a suddenness which will surprise everybody.&rsquo; The chief, to my
      astonishment, consented without a murmur, and even upbraided me for not
      going away sooner. Then the doctor said to me: &lsquo;You get some companion&mdash;some
      man with no brains, if possible, who will not discuss politics, who has no
      opinion on anything that any sane man would care to talk about, and who
      couldn&rsquo;t say a bright thing if he tried for a year. Get such a man to go
      off to the woods somewhere. Up in Maine or in Canada. As far away from
      post offices and telegraph offices as possible. And, by the way, don&rsquo;t
      leave your address at the <i>Argus</i> office.&rsquo; Thus it happened, Stilly,
      when he described this man so graphically, I at once thought of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am deeply gratified, I am sure,&rdquo; said the professor, with the ghost of
      a smile, &ldquo;to be so promptly remembered in such a connection, and if I can
      be of service to you, I shall be very glad. I take it, then, that you have
      no intention of stopping in Buffalo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m in for the forest primeval, the murmuring pines
      and the hemlock, bearded with moss and green in the something or other&mdash;I
      forget the rest. I want to quit lying on paper, and lie on my back
      instead, on the sward or in a hammock. I&rsquo;m going to avoid all boarding
      houses or delightful summer resorts, and go in for the quiet of the
      forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ought to be some nice places along the lake shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. No lake shore for me. It would remind me of the Lake Shore
      Railroad when it was calm, and of Long Branch when it was rough. <i>No</i>,
      sir. The woods, the woods, and the woods. I have hired a tent and a lot of
      cooking things. I&rsquo;m going to take that tent over to Canada to-morrow; and
      then I propose we engage a man with a team to cart it somewhere into the
      woods, fifteen or twenty miles away. We shall have to be near a farmhouse,
      so that we can get fresh butter, milk, and eggs. This, of course, is a
      disadvantage; but I shall try to get near someone who has never even heard
      of New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may find that somewhat difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I have great hopes of the lack of intelligence in the
      Canadians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often the narrowest,&rdquo; said the professor slowly, &ldquo;are those who think
      themselves the most cosmopolitan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; cried Yates, skimming lightly over the remark, and seeing
      nothing applicable to his case in it. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve laid in about half a
      ton, more or less, of tobacco, and have bought an empty jug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An empty one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Among the few things worth having that the Canadians possess, is
      good whisky. Besides, the empty jar will save trouble at the customhouse.
      I don&rsquo;t suppose Canadian rye is as good as the Kentucky article, but you
      and I will have to scrub along on it for a while. And, talking of whisky,
      just press the button once again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor did so, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor made no remark, I suppose, about drinking less or smoking
      less, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my case? Well, come to think of it, there <i>was</i> some conversation
      in that direction. Don&rsquo;t remember at the moment just what it amounted to;
      but all physicians have their little fads, you know. It doesn&rsquo;t do to
      humor them too much. Ah, boy, there you are again. Well, the professor
      wants another drink. Make it a gin fizz this time, and put plenty of ice
      in it; but don&rsquo;t neglect the gin on that account. Certainly; charge it to
      room 518.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this tackle?&rdquo; asked the burly and somewhat red-faced customs
      officer at Fort Erie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;is a tent, with the poles and pegs appertaining
      thereto. These are a number of packages of tobacco, on which I shall
      doubtless have to pay something into the exchequer of her Majesty. This is
      a jug used for the holding of liquids. I beg to call your attention to the
      fact that it is at present empty, which unfortunately prevents me making a
      libation to the rites of good-fellowship. What my friend has in that
      valise I don&rsquo;t know, but I suspect a gambling outfit, and would advise you
      to search him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My valise contains books principally, with some articles of wearing
      apparel,&rdquo; said the professor, opening his grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The customs officer looked with suspicion on the whole outfit, and
      evidently did not like the tone of the American. He seemed to be treating
      the customs department in a light and airy manner, and the officer was too
      much impressed by the dignity of his position not to resent flippancy.
      Besides, there were rumors of Fenian invasion in the air, and the officer
      resolved that no Fenian should get into the country without paying duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going with this tent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps you can tell us. I don&rsquo;t know the country
      about here. Say, Stilly, I&rsquo;m off uptown to attend to the emptiness in this
      stone utensil. I&rsquo;ve been empty too often myself not to sympathize with its
      condition. You wrestle this matter out about the tent. You know the ways
      of the country, whereas I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps as well that Yates left negotiations in the hands of his
      friend. He was quick enough to see that he made no headway with the
      officer, but rather the opposite. He slung the jar ostentatiously over his
      shoulder, to the evident discomfort of the professor, and marched up the
      hill to the nearest tavern, whistling one of the lately popular war tunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to the barkeeper, placing the jar tenderly on the bar,
      &ldquo;fill that up to the nozzle with the best rye you have. Fill it with the
      old familiar juice, as the late poet Omar saith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender did as he was requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you disguise a little of that fluid in any way, so that it may be
      taken internally without a man suspecting what he is swallowing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The barkeeper smiled. &ldquo;How would a cocktail fill the vacancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can suggest nothing better,&rdquo; replied Yates. &ldquo;If you are sure you know
      how to make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man did not resent this imputation of ignorance. He merely said, with
      the air of one who gives an incontrovertible answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Kentucky man myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake!&rdquo; cried Yates briefly, as he reached his hand across the bar. &ldquo;How
      is it you happened to be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I got in to a little trouble in Louisville, and here I am, where I
      can at least look at God&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; protested Yates. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making only <i>one</i> cocktail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say one?&rdquo; asked the man, pausing in the compounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, I never saw one cocktail made in my life. You are with me on
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; replied the other, as he prepared enough for two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you my fix,&rdquo; said Yates confidentially. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a tent
      and some camp things down below at the customhouse shanty, and I want to
      get them taken into the woods, where I can camp out with a friend. I want
      a place where we can have absolute rest and quiet. Do you know the country
      round here? Perhaps you could recommend a spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for all the time I&rsquo;ve been here, I know precious little about the
      back country. I&rsquo;ve been down the road to Niagara Falls, but never back in
      the woods. I suppose you want some place by the lake or the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I want to get clear back into the forest&mdash;if there is a
      forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a man in to-day from somewhere near Ridgeway, I think. He&rsquo;s
      got a hay rack with him, and that would be just the thing to take your
      tent and poles. Wouldn&rsquo;t be very comfortable traveling for you, but it
      would be all right for the tent, if it&rsquo;s a big one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will suit us exactly. We don&rsquo;t care a cent about the comfort.
      Roughing it is what we came for. Where will I find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be along here soon. That&rsquo;s his team tied there on the side
      street. If he happens to be in good humor, he&rsquo;ll take your things, and as
      like as not give you a place to camp in his woods. Hiram Bartlett&rsquo;s his
      name. And, talking of the old Nick himself, here he is. I say, Mr.
      Bartlett, this gentleman was wondering if you couldn&rsquo;t tote out some of
      his belongings. He&rsquo;s going out your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett was a somewhat uncouth and wiry specimen of the Canadian farmer
      who evidently paid little attention to the subject of dress. He said
      nothing, but looked in a lowering way at Yates, with something of contempt
      and suspicion in his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates had one receipt for making the acquaintance of all mankind. &ldquo;Come
      in, Mr. Bartlett,&rdquo; he said cheerily, &ldquo;and try one of my friend&rsquo;s excellent
      cocktails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take mine straight,&rdquo; growled Bartlett gruffly, although he stepped
      inside the open door. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want no Yankee mixtures in mine. Plain
      whisky&rsquo;s good enough for any man, if he <i>is</i> a man. I don&rsquo;t take no
      water, neither. I&rsquo;ve got trouble enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender winked at Yates as he shoved the decanter over to the
      newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; assented Yates cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer did not thaw out in the least because of this prompt agreement
      with him, but sipped his whisky gloomily, as if it were a most
      disagreeable medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you want me to take out?&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend and a tent, a jug of whisky and a lot of jolly good tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much are you willing to pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m always willing to do what&rsquo;s right. How would five
      dollars strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer scowled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; he said, as Yates was about to offer more. &ldquo;&lsquo;Taint worth it.
      Two and a half would be about the right figure. Don&rsquo;no but that&rsquo;s too
      much. I&rsquo;ll think on it going home, and charge you what it&rsquo;s worth. I&rsquo;ll be
      ready to leave in about an hour, if that suits you. That&rsquo;s my team on the
      other side of the road. If it&rsquo;s gone when you come back, I&rsquo;m gone, an&rsquo; 
      you&rsquo;ll have to get somebody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this Bartlett drew his coat sleeve across his mouth and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him exactly,&rdquo; said the barkeeper. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the most cantankerous
      crank in the township. And say, let me give you a pointer. If the subject
      of 1812 comes up,&mdash;the war, you know,&mdash;you&rsquo;d better admit that
      we got thrashed out of our boots; that is, if you want to get along with
      Hiram. He hates Yankees like poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did we get thrashed in 1812?&rdquo; asked Yates, who was more familiar with
      current topics than with the history of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if I know. Hiram says we did. I told him once that we got what we
      wanted from old England, and he nearly hauled me over the bar. So I give
      you the warning, if you want to get along with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll remember it. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This friendly hint from the man in the tavern offers a key to the solution
      of the problem of Yates&rsquo; success on the New York press. He could get news
      when no other man could. Flippant and shallow as he undoubtedly was, he
      somehow got into the inner confidences of all sorts of men in a way that
      made them give him an inkling of anything that was going on for the mere
      love of him; and thus Yates often received valuable assistance from his
      acquaintances which other reporters could not get for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Yorker found the professor sitting on a bench by the customhouse,
      chatting with the officer, and gazing at the rapidly flowing broad blue
      river in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got a man,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;who will take us out into the wilderness
      in about an hour&rsquo;s time. Suppose we explore the town. I expect nobody will
      run away with the tent till we come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after that,&rdquo; said the officer; and, thanking him, the two
      friends strolled up the street. They were a trifle late in getting back,
      and when they reached the tavern, they found Bartlett just on the point of
      driving home. He gruffly consented to take them, if they did not keep him
      more than five minutes loading up. The tent and its belongings were
      speedily placed on the hay rack, and then Bartlett drove up to the tavern
      and waited, saying nothing, although he had been in such a hurry a few
      moments before. Yates did not like to ask the cause of the delay; so the
      three sat there silently. After a while Yates said as mildly as he could:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you waiting for anyone, Mr. Bartlett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the driver in a surly tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for you to go in
      fur that jug. I don&rsquo;t suppose you filled it to leave it on the counter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Yates, springing off, &ldquo;I had forgotten all about it,
      which shows the extraordinary effect this country has on me already.&rdquo; The
      professor frowned, but Yates came out merrily, with the jar in his hand,
      and Bartlett started his team. They drove out of the village and up a
      slight hill, going for a mile or two along a straight and somewhat sandy
      road. Then they turned into the Ridge Road, as Bartlett called it, in
      answer to a question by the professor, and there was no need to ask why it
      was so termed. It was a good highway, but rather stony, the road being, in
      places, on the bare rock. It paid not the slightest attention to Euclid&rsquo;s
      definition of a straight line, and in this respect was rather a welcome
      change from the average American road. Sometimes they passed along avenues
      of overbranching trees, which were evidently relics of the forest that
      once covered all the district. The road followed the ridge, and on each
      side were frequently to be seen wide vistas of lower lying country. All
      along the road were comfortable farmhouses; and it was evident that a
      prosperous community flourished along the ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett spoke only once, and then to the professor, who sat next to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a Canadian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s <i>he</i> from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend is from New York,&rdquo; answered the innocent professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Bartlett, scowling deeper than ever, after which he
      became silent again. The team was not going very fast, although neither
      the load nor the road was heavy. Bartlett was muttering a good deal to
      himself, and now and then brought down his whip savagely on one or the
      other of the horses; but the moment the unfortunate animals quickened
      their pace he hauled them in roughly. Nevertheless, they were going
      quickly enough to be overtaking a young woman who was walking on alone.
      Although she must have heard them coming over the rocky road she did not
      turn her head, but walked along with the free and springy step of one who
      is not only accustomed to walking, but who likes it. Bartlett paid no
      attention to the girl; the professor was endeavoring to read his thin book
      as well as a man might who is being jolted frequently; but Yates, as soon
      as he recognized that the pedestrian was young, pulled up his collar,
      adjusted his necktie with care, and placed his hat in a somewhat more
      jaunty and fetching position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to offer that girl a ride?&rdquo; he said to Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is rather uncivil,&rdquo; he added, forgetting the warning he had
      had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do, eh? Well, you offer her a ride. You hired the team.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I will,&rdquo; said Yates, placing his hand on the outside of the
      rack, and springing lightly to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likely thing,&rdquo; growled Bartlett to the professor, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s going to
      ride with the like of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor looked for a moment at Yates, politely taking off his hat to
      the apparently astonished young woman, but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fur two cents,&rdquo; continued Bartlett, gathering up the reins, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d whip up
      the horses, and let him walk the rest of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I know of my friend,&rdquo; answered the professor slowly, &ldquo;I think
      he would not object in the slightest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett muttered something to himself, and seemed to change his mind
      about galloping his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Yates, as has been said, took off his hat with great politeness
      to the fair pedestrian, and as he did so he noticed, with a thrill of
      admiration, that she was very handsome. Yates always had an eye for the
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our conveyance,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;is not as comfortable as it might be, yet I
      shall be very happy if you will accept its hospitalities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman flashed a brief glance at him from her dark eyes, and for
      a moment Yates feared that his language had been rather too choice for her
      rural understanding, but before he could amend his phrase she answered
      briefly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I prefer to walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that I blame you. May I ask if you have come all the
      way from the village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a long distance, and you must be very tired.&rdquo; There was no reply;
      so Yates continued. &ldquo;At least, I thought it a long distance; but perhaps
      that was because I was riding on Bartlett&rsquo;s hay rack. There is no &lsquo;downy
      bed of ease&rsquo; about his vehicle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke of the wagon he looked at it, and, striding forward to its
      side, said in a husky whisper to the professor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Stilly, cover up that jug with a flap of the tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cover it up yourself,&rdquo; briefly replied the other; &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates reached across and, in a sort of accidental way, threw the flap of
      the tent over the too conspicuous jar. As an excuse for his action he took
      up his walking cane and turned toward his new acquaintance. He was
      flattered to see that she was loitering some distance behind the wagon,
      and he speedily rejoined her. The girl, looking straight ahead, now
      quickened her pace, and rapidly shortened the distance between herself and
      the vehicle. Yates, with the quickness characteristic of him, made up his
      mind that this was a case of country diffidence, which was best to be met
      by the bringing down of his conversation to the level of his hearer&rsquo;s
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been marketing?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Butter and eggs, and that sort of thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are farmers,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and we sell butter and eggs&rdquo;&mdash;a
      pause&mdash;&ldquo;and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates laughed in his light and cheery way. As he twirled his cane he
      looked at his pretty companion. She was gazing anxiously ahead toward a
      turn in the road. Her comely face was slightly flushed, doubtless with the
      exercise of walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, in my country,&rdquo; continued the New Yorker, &ldquo;we idolize our women.
      Pretty girls don&rsquo;t tramp miles to market with butter and eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the girls pretty&mdash;in your country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates made a mental note that there was not as much rurality about this
      girl as he had thought at first. There was a piquancy about the
      conversation which he liked. That she shared his enjoyment was doubtful,
      for a slight line of resentment was noticeable on her smooth brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet they&rsquo;re pretty! I think all American girls are pretty. It seems
      their birthright. When I say American, I mean the whole continent, of
      course. I&rsquo;m from the States myself&mdash;from New York.&rdquo; He gave an extra
      twirl to his cane as he said this, and bore himself with that air of
      conscious superiority which naturally pertains to a citizen of the
      metropolis. &ldquo;But over in the States we think the men should do all the
      work, and that the women should&mdash;well, spend the money. I must do our
      ladies the justice to say that they attend strictly to their share of the
      arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should be a delightful country to live in&mdash;for the women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all say so. We used to have an adage to the effect that America was
      paradise for women, purgatory for men, and&mdash;well, an entirely
      different sort of place for oxen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt that Yates had a way of getting along with people. As
      he looked at his companion he was gratified to note just the faintest
      suspicion of a smile hovering about her lips. Before she could answer, if
      she had intended to do so, there was a quick clatter of hoofs on the hard
      road ahead, and next instant an elegant buggy, whose slender jet-black
      polished spokes flashed and twinkled in the sunlight, came dashing past
      the wagon. On seeing the two walking together the driver hauled up his
      team with a suddenness that was evidently not relished by the spirited
      dappled span he drove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Margaret!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;am I late? Have you walked in all the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just in good time,&rdquo; answered the girl, without looking toward
      Yates, who stood aimlessly twirling his cane. The young woman put her foot
      on the buggy step, and sprang lightly in beside the driver. It needed no
      second glance to see that he was her brother, not only on account of the
      family resemblance between them, but also because he allowed her to get
      into the buggy without offering the slightest assistance, which, indeed,
      was not needed, and graciously permitted her to place the duster that
      covered his knees over her own lap as well. The restive team trotted
      rapidly down the road for a few rods, until they came to a wide place in
      the highway, and then whirled around, seemingly within an ace of upsetting
      the buggy; but the young man evidently knew his business, and held them in
      with a firm hand. The wagon was jogging along where the road was very
      narrow, and Bartlett kept his team stolidly in the center of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, there, Bartlett!&rdquo; shouted the young man in the buggy; &ldquo;half the
      road, you know&mdash;half the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; cried Bartlett over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Bartlett, get out of the way, or I&rsquo;ll run you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett either had no sense of humor or his resentment against his young
      neighbor smothered it, since otherwise he would have recognized that a
      heavy wagon was in no danger of being run into by a light and expensive
      buggy. The young man kept his temper admirably, but he knew just where to
      touch the elder on the raw. His sister&rsquo;s hand was placed appealingly on
      his arm. He smiled, and took no notice of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now, you move out, or I&rsquo;ll have the law on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law!&rdquo; roared Bartlett; &ldquo;you just try it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should think you&rsquo;d had enough of it by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, Henry!&rdquo; protested the girl in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aint no law,&rdquo; yelled Bartlett, &ldquo;that kin make a man with a load
      move out fur anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any load, unless it&rsquo;s in that jug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates saw with consternation that the jar had been jolted out from under
      its covering, but the happy consolation came to him that the two in the
      buggy would believe it belonged to Bartlett. He thought, however, that
      this dog-in-the-manger policy had gone far enough. He stepped briskly
      forward, and said to Bartlett:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better drive aside a little, and let them pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You &lsquo;tend to your own business,&rdquo; cried the thoroughly enraged farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Yates shortly, striding to the horses&rsquo; heads. He took them
      by the bits and, in spite of Bartlett&rsquo;s maledictions and pulling at the
      lines, he drew them to one side, so that the buggy got by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; cried the young man. The light and glittering carriage
      rapidly disappeared up the Ridge Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett sat there for one moment the picture of baffled rage. Then he
      threw the reins down on the backs of his patient horses, and descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take my horses by the head, do you, you good-fur-nuthin&rsquo; Yank? You
      do, eh? I like your cheek. Touch my horses an&rsquo; me a-holdin&rsquo; the lines! Now
      you hear me? Your traps comes right off here on the road. You hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, anybody within a mile can hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kin they? Well, off comes your pesky tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it, eh? Well, then, you&rsquo;ll lick me fust; and that&rsquo;s something no
      Yank ever did nor kin do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; cried the professor, getting down on the road, &ldquo;this has
      gone far enough. Keep quiet, Yates. Now, Mr. Bartlett, don&rsquo;t mind it; he
      means no disrespect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you interfere. You&rsquo;re all right, an&rsquo; I aint got nothin&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in you.
      But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to thrash this Yank within an inch of his life; see if I
      don&rsquo;t. We met &lsquo;em in 1812, an&rsquo; we fit &lsquo;em an&rsquo; we licked &lsquo;em, an&rsquo; we can do
      it ag&rsquo;in. I&rsquo;ll learn ye to take my horses by the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teach,&rdquo; suggested Yates tantalizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could properly defend himself, Bartlett sprang at him and
      grasped him round the waist. Yates was something of a wrestler himself,
      but his skill was of no avail on this occasion. Bartlett&rsquo;s right leg
      became twisted around his with a steel-like grip that speedily convinced
      the younger man he would have to give way or a bone would break. He gave
      way accordingly, and the next thing he knew he came down on his back with
      a thud that seemed to shake the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, darn ye!&rdquo; cried the triumphant farmer; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s 1812 and Queenstown
      Heights for ye. How do you like &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates rose to his feet with some deliberation, and slowly took off his
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now, Yates,&rdquo; said the professor soothingly, &ldquo;let it go at this.
      You&rsquo;re not hurt, are you?&rdquo; he asked anxiously, as he noticed how white the
      young man was around the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Renmark; you&rsquo;re a sensible man. There is a time to interfere
      and a time not to. This is the time not to. A certain international
      element seems to have crept into this dispute. Now, you stand aside, like
      a good fellow, for I don&rsquo;t want to have to thrash both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor stood aside, for he realized that, when Yates called him by
      his last name, matters were serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, old chucklehead, perhaps you would like to try that again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kin do it a dozen times, if ye aint satisfied. There aint no Yank ever
      raised on pumpkin pie that can stand ag&rsquo;in that grapevine twist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try the grapevine once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett proceeded more cautiously this time, for there was a look in the
      young man&rsquo;s face he did not quite like. He took a catch-as-catch-can
      attitude, and moved stealthily in a semi-circle around Yates, who shifted
      his position constantly so as to keep facing his foe. At last Bartlett
      sprang forward, and the next instant found himself sitting on a piece of
      the rock of the country, with a thousand humming birds buzzing in his
      head, while stars and the landscape around joined in a dance together. The
      blow was sudden, well placed, and from the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Yates, standing over him, &ldquo;is 1776&mdash;the Revolution&mdash;when,
      to use your own phrase, we met ye, fit ye, and licked ye. How do you like
      it? Now, if my advice is of any use to you, take a broader view of history
      than you have done. Don&rsquo;t confine yourself too much to one period. Study
      up the War of the Revolution a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett made no reply. After sitting there for a while, until the
      surrounding landscape assumed its normal condition, he arose leisurely,
      without saying a word. He picked the reins from the backs of the horses
      and patted the nearest animal gently. Then he mounted to his place and
      drove off. The professor had taken his seat beside the driver, but Yates,
      putting on his coat and picking up his cane, strode along in front,
      switching off the heads of Canada thistles with his walking stick as he
      proceeded.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bartlett was silent for a long time, but there was evidently something on
      his mind, for he communed with himself, his mutterings growing louder and
      louder, until they broke the stillness; then he struck the horses, pulled
      them in, and began his soliloquy over again. At last he said abruptly to
      the professor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this Revolution he talked about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the War of Independence, beginning in 1776.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of it. Did the Yanks fight us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The colonies fought with England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What colonies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country now called the United States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They fit with England, eh? Which licked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The colonies won their independence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means they licked us. I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. &lsquo;Pears to me I&rsquo;d
      &lsquo;a&rsquo; heard of it; fur I&rsquo;ve lived in these parts a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a little before your day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was 1812; but my father fit in it, an&rsquo; I never heard him tell of this
      Revolution. He&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; known, I sh&rsquo;d think. There&rsquo;s a nigger in the fence
      somewheres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, England was rather busy at the time with the French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was it, was it? I&rsquo;ll bet England never knew the Revolution was
      a-goin&rsquo; on till it was over. Old Napoleon couldn&rsquo;t thrash &lsquo;em, and it
      don&rsquo;t stand to reason that the Yanks could. I thought there was some
      skullduggery. Why, it took the Yanks four years to lick themselves. I got
      a book at home all about Napoleon. He was a tough cuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor did not feel called upon to defend the character of
      Napoleon, and so silence once more descended upon them. Bartlett seemed a
      good deal disturbed by the news he had just heard of the Revolution, and
      he growled to himself, while the horses suffered more than usual from the
      whip and the hauling back that invariably followed the stroke. Yates was
      some distance ahead, and swinging along at a great rate, when the horses,
      apparently of their own accord, turned in at an open gateway and
      proceeded, in their usual leisurely fashion, toward a large barn, past a
      comfortable frame house with a wide veranda in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my place,&rdquo; said Bartlett shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had told me a few minutes ago,&rdquo; replied the professor,
      springing off, &ldquo;so that I might have called to my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not frettin&rsquo; about him,&rdquo; said Bartlett, throwing the reins to a young
      man who came out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark ran to the road and shouted loudly to the distant Yates. Yates
      apparently did not hear him, but something about the next house attracted
      the pedestrian&rsquo;s attention, and after standing for a moment and gazing
      toward the west he looked around and saw the professor beckoning to him.
      When the two men met, Yates said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we have arrived, have we? I say, Stilly, she lives in the next house.
      I saw the buggy in the yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She? Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that good-looking girl we passed on the road. I&rsquo;m going to buy our
      supplies at that house, Stilly, if you have no objections. By the way, how
      is my old friend 1812?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to harbor any harsh feelings. In fact, he was more
      troubled about the Revolution than about the blow you gave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News to him, eh? Well, I&rsquo;m glad I knocked something into his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly did it most unscientifically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;unscientifically?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the delivery of the blow. I never saw a more awkwardly delivered
      undercut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates looked at his friend in astonishment. How should this calm, learned
      man know anything about undercuts or science in blows?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must admit I got there just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by brute force. A sledge hammer would have done as well. But you had
      such an opportunity to do it neatly and deftly, without any display of
      surplus energy, that I regretted to see such an opening thrown away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens and earth, Stilly, this is the professor in a new light! What do
      you teach in Toronto University, anyhow? The noble art of self-defense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly; but if you intend to go through Canada in this belligerent
      manner, I think it would be worth your while to take a few hints from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With striking examples, I suppose. By Jove! I will, Stilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the two came to the house they found Bartlett sitting in a wooden
      rocking chair on the veranda, looking grimly down the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an old tyrant that man must be in his home!&rdquo; said Yates. There was
      no time for the professor to reply before they came within earshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old woman&rsquo;s setting out supper,&rdquo; said the farmer gruffly, that piece
      of information being apparently as near as he could get toward inviting
      them to share his hospitality. Yates didn&rsquo;t know whether it was meant for
      an invitation or not, but he answered shortly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, we won&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak fur yourself, please,&rdquo; snarled Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I go with my friend,&rdquo; said Renmark; &ldquo;but we are obliged for the
      invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried a cheery voice from the inside of the house, as a
      stout, rosy, and very good-natured-looking woman appeared at the front
      door. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t stay? <i>Who</i> won&rsquo;t stay? I&rsquo;d like to see anybody leave my
      house hungry when there&rsquo;s a meal on the table! And, young men, if you can
      get a better meal anywhere on the Ridge than what I&rsquo;ll give you, why,
      you&rsquo;re welcome to go there next time, but this meal you&rsquo;ll have here,
      inside of ten minutes. Hiram, that&rsquo;s your fault. You always invite a
      person to dinner as if you wanted to wrastle with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hiram gave a guilty start, and looked with something of mute appeal at the
      two men, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Bartlett. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re at my house; and,
      whatever my neighbors may say ag&rsquo;in me, I never heard anybody complain of
      the lack of good victuals while I was able to do the cooking. Come right
      in and wash yourselves, for the road between here and the fort is dusty
      enough, even if Hiram never was taken up for fast driving. Besides, a wash
      is refreshing after a hot day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no denying the cordiality of this invitation, and Yates, whose
      natural gallantry was at once aroused, responded with the readiness of a
      courtier. Mrs. Bartlett led the way into the house; but as Yates passed
      the farmer the latter cleared his throat with an effort, and, throwing his
      thumb over his shoulder in the direction his wife had taken, said in a
      husky whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No call to&mdash;to mention the Revolution, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; answered Yates, with a wink that took in the situation.
      &ldquo;Shall we sample the jug before or after supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you;&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;out in the barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates nodded, and followed his friend into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men were shown into a bedroom of more than ordinary size, on the
      upper floor. Everything about the house was of the most dainty and
      scrupulous cleanliness, and an air of cheerful comfort pervaded the place.
      Mrs. Bartlett was evidently a housekeeper to be proud of. Two large
      pitchers of cool, soft water awaited them, and the wash, as had been
      predicted, was most refreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; cried Yates, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather cheeky to accept a man&rsquo;s hospitality
      after knocking him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be for most people, but I think you underestimate your cheek, as
      you call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Stilly! You&rsquo;re blossoming out. That&rsquo;s repartee, that is. With the
      accent on the rap, too. Never you mind; I think old 1812 and I will get on
      all right after this. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother him any, so I don&rsquo;t see
      why it should worry me. Nice motherly old lady, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? 1812?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mrs. 1812. I&rsquo;m sorry I complimented you on your repartee. You&rsquo;ll get
      conceited. Remember that what in the newspaper man is clever, in a grave
      professor is rank flippancy. Let&rsquo;s go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The table was covered with a cloth as white and spotless as good linen can
      well be. The bread was genuine homemade, a term so often misused in the
      cities. It was brown as to crust, and flaky and light as to interior. The
      butter, cool from the rock cellar, was of a refreshing yellow hue. The
      sight of the well-loaded table was most welcome to the eyes of hungry
      travelers. There was, as Yates afterward remarked, &ldquo;abundance, and plenty
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, father!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett, as the young men appeared; they heard
      the rocking chair creak on the veranda in prompt answer to the summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my son, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bartlett, indicating the young man
      who stood in a noncommittal attitude near a corner of the room. The
      professor recognized him as the person who had taken charge of the horses
      when his father came home. There was evidently something of his father&rsquo;s
      demeanor about the young man, who awkwardly and silently responded to the
      recognition of the strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is my daughter,&rdquo; continued the good woman. &ldquo;Now, what might your
      names be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Yates, and this is my friend Professor Renmark of T&rsquo;ronto,&rdquo;
       pronouncing the name of the fair city in two syllables, as is, alas! too
      often done. The professor bowed, and Yates cordially extended his hand to
      the young woman. &ldquo;How do you do, Miss Bartlett?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am happy to
      meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled very prettily, and said she hoped they had a pleasant trip
      out from Fort Erie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we had,&rdquo; said Yates, looking for a moment at his host, whose eyes
      were fixed on the tablecloth, and who appeared to be quite content to let
      his wife run the show. &ldquo;The road&rsquo;s a little rocky in places, but it&rsquo;s very
      pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you sit down here, and you here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bartlett; &ldquo;and I do hope
      you have brought good appetites with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strangers took their places, and Yates had a chance to look at the
      younger member of the family, which opportunity he did not let slip. It
      was hard to believe that she was the daughter of so crusty a man as Hiram
      Bartlett. Her cheeks were rosy, with dimples in them that constantly came
      and went in her incessant efforts to keep from laughing. Her hair, which
      hung about her plump shoulders, was a lovely golden brown. Although her
      dress was of the cheapest material, it was neatly cut and fitted; and her
      dainty white apron added that touch of wholesome cleanliness which was so
      noticeable everywhere in the house. A bit of blue ribbon at her white
      throat, and a pretty spring flower just below it, completed a charming
      picture, which a more critical and less susceptible man than Yates might
      have contemplated with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bartlett sat smilingly at one end of the table, and her father grimly
      at the other. The mother sat at the side, apparently looking on that
      position as one of vantage for commanding the whole field, and keeping her
      husband and her daughter both under her eye. The teapot and cups were set
      before the young woman. She did not pour out the tea at once, but seemed
      to be waiting instructions from her mother. That good lady was gazing with
      some sternness at her husband, he vainly endeavoring to look at the
      ceiling or anywhere but at her. He drew his open hand nervously down his
      face, which was of unusual gravity even for him. Finally he cast an
      appealing glance at his wife, who sat with her hands folded on her lap,
      but her eyes were unrelenting. After a moment&rsquo;s hopeless irresolution
      Bartlett bent his head over his plate and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what we are about to receive, oh, make us truly thankful. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bartlett echoed the last word, having also bowed her head when she
      saw surrender in the troubled eyes of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it happened that Yates, who had seen nothing of this silent struggle
      of the eyes, being exceedingly hungry, was making every preparation for
      the energetic beginning of the meal. He had spent most of his life in
      hotels and New York boarding houses, so that if he ever knew the adage,
      &ldquo;Grace before meat,&rdquo; he had forgotten it. In the midst of his preparations
      came the devout words, and they came upon him as a stupefying surprise.
      Although naturally a resourceful man, he was not quick enough this time to
      cover his confusion. Miss Bartlett&rsquo;s golden head was bowed, but out of the
      corner of her eye she saw Yates&rsquo; look of amazed bewilderment and his
      sudden halt of surprise. When all heads were raised, the young girl&rsquo;s
      still remained where it was, while her plump shoulders quivered. Then she
      covered her face with her apron, and the silvery ripple of a laugh came
      like a smothered musical chime trickling through her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, <i>Kitty</i>!&rdquo; cried her mother in astonishment, &ldquo;whatever is the
      matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl could no longer restrain her mirth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pour out the
      tea, mother!&rdquo; She exclaimed, as she fled from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried the astonished mother, rising to take her
      frivolous daughter&rsquo;s place, &ldquo;what ails the child? I don&rsquo;t see what there
      is to laugh at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hiram scowled down the table, and was evidently also of the opinion that
      there was no occasion for mirth. The professor was equally in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, Mrs. Bartlett,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;that I am the innocent cause of
      Miss Kitty&rsquo;s mirth. You see, madam&mdash;it&rsquo;s a pathetic thing to say, but
      really I have had no home life. Although I attend church regularly, of
      course,&rdquo; he added with jaunty mendacity, &ldquo;I must confess that I haven&rsquo;t
      heard grace at meals for years and years, and&mdash;well, I wasn&rsquo;t just
      prepared for it. I have no doubt I made an exhibition of myself, which
      your daughter was quick to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t very polite,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bartlett with some asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; pleaded Yates with contrition, &ldquo;but I assure you it was
      unintentional on my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless the man!&rdquo; cried his hostess. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean you. I mean Kitty. But
      that girl never <i>could</i> keep her face straight. She always favored me
      more than her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This statement was not difficult to believe, for Hiram at that moment
      looked as if he had never smiled in his life. He sat silent throughout the
      meal, but Mrs. Bartlett talked quite enough for two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what farming&rsquo;s coming to!
      Henry Howard and Margaret drove past here this afternoon as proud as Punch
      in their new covered buggy. Things is very different from what they was
      when I was a girl. Then a farmer&rsquo;s daughter had to work. Now Margaret&rsquo;s
      took her diploma at the ladies&rsquo; college, and Arthur he&rsquo;s begun at the
      university, and Henry&rsquo;s sporting round in a new buggy. They have a piano
      there, with the organ moved out into the back room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole Howard lot&rsquo;s a stuck-up set,&rdquo; muttered the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Bartlett wouldn&rsquo;t have that. Any detraction that was necessary
      she felt competent to supply, without help from the nominal head of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t go so far as to say that. Neither would you, Hiram, if you
      hadn&rsquo;t lost your lawsuit about the line fence; and served you right, too,
      for it wouldn&rsquo;t have been begun if I had been at home at the time. Not but
      what Margaret&rsquo;s a good housekeeper, for she wouldn&rsquo;t be her mother&rsquo;s
      daughter if she wasn&rsquo;t that; but it does seem to me a queer way to raise
      farmers&rsquo; children, and I only hope they can keep it up. There were no
      pianos nor French and German in <i>my</i> young days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to hear her play! My lands!&rdquo; cried young Bartlett, who spoke
      for the first time. His admiration for her accomplishment evidently went
      beyond his powers of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett himself did not relish the turn the conversation had taken, and
      he looked somewhat uneasily at the two strangers. The professor&rsquo;s
      countenance was open and frank, and he was listening with respectful
      interest to Mrs. Bartlett&rsquo;s talk. Yates bent over his plate with flushed
      face, and confined himself strictly to the business in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said the professor innocently to Yates, &ldquo;that you made the
      young lady&rsquo;s acquaintance. I must ask you for an introduction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once in his life Yates had nothing to say, but he looked at his friend
      with an expression that was not kindly. The latter, in answer to Mrs.
      Bartlett&rsquo;s inquiries, told how they had passed Miss Howard on the road,
      and how Yates, with his usual kindness of heart, had offered the young
      woman the hospitalities of the hay rack. Two persons at the table were
      much relieved when the talk turned to the tent. It was young Hiram who
      brought about this boon. He was interested in the tent, and he wanted to
      know. Two things seemed to bother the boy: First, he was anxious to learn
      what diabolical cause had been at work to induce two apparently sane men
      to give up the comforts of home and live in this exposed manner, if they
      were not compelled to do so. Second, he desired to find out why people who
      had the privilege of living in large cities came of their own accord into
      the uninteresting country, anyhow. Even when explanations were offered,
      the problem seemed still beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the meal they all adjourned to the veranda, where the air was cool
      and the view extensive. Mrs. Bartlett would not hear of the young men
      pitching the tent that night. &ldquo;Goodness knows, you will have enough of it,
      with the rain and the mosquitoes. We have plenty of room here, and you
      will have one comfortable night on the Ridge, at any rate. Then in the
      morning you can find a place in the woods to suit you, and my boy will
      take an ax and cut stakes for you, and help to put up your precious tent.
      Only remember that when it rains you are to come to the house, or you will
      catch your deaths with cold and rheumatism. It will be very nice till the
      novelty wears off; then you are quite welcome to the front rooms upstairs,
      and Hiram can take the tent back to Erie the first time he goes to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bartlett had a way of taking things for granted. It never seemed to
      occur to her that any of her rulings might be questioned. Hiram sat gazing
      silently at the road, as if all this was no affair of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates had refused a chair, and sat on the edge of the veranda, with his
      back against one of the pillars, in such a position that he might, without
      turning his head, look through the open doorway into the room. where Miss
      Bartlett was busily but silently clearing away the tea things. The young
      man caught fleeting glimpses of her as she moved airily about her work. He
      drew a cigar from his case, cut off the end with his knife, and lit a
      match on the sole of his boot, doing this with an easy automatic
      familiarity that required no attention on his part; all of which aroused
      the respectful envy of young Hiram, who sat on a wooden chair, leaning
      forward, eagerly watching the man from New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cigar?&rdquo; said Yates, offering the case to young Hiram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; thank you,&rdquo; gasped the boy, aghast at the reckless audacity of
      the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett. Although she was talking volubly to
      the professor, her maternal vigilance never even nodded, much less slept.
      &ldquo;A cigar? Not likely! I&rsquo;ll say this for my husband and my boy: that,
      whatever else they may have done, they have never smoked nor touched a
      drop of liquor since I&rsquo;ve known them, and, please God, they never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt them,&rdquo; said Yates, with a lack of tact that
      was not habitual. He fell several degrees in the estimation of his
      hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt &lsquo;em?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett indignantly. &ldquo;I guess it won&rsquo;t get a
      chance to.&rdquo; She turned to the professor, who was a good listener&mdash;respectful
      and deferential, with little to say for himself. She rocked gently to and
      fro as she talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband sat unbendingly silent, in a sphinxlike attitude that gave no
      outward indication of his mental uneasiness. He was thinking gloomily that
      it would be just his luck to meet Mrs. Bartlett unexpectedly in the
      streets of Fort Erie on one of those rare occasions when he was enjoying
      the pleasures of sin for a season. He had the most pessimistic forebodings
      of what the future might have in store for him. Sometimes, when neighbors
      or customers &ldquo;treated&rdquo; him in the village, and he felt he had taken all
      the whisky that cloves would conceal, he took a five-cent cigar instead of
      a drink. He did not particularly like the smoking of it, but there was a
      certain devil-may-care recklessness in going down the street with a
      lighted cigar in his teeth, which had all the more fascination for him
      because of its manifest danger. He felt at these times that he was going
      the pace, and that it is well our women do not know of all the wickedness
      there is in this world. He did not fear that any neighbor might tell his
      wife, for there were depths to which no person could convince Mrs.
      Bartlett he would descend. But he thought with horror of some combination
      of circumstances that might bring his wife to town unknown to him on a day
      when he indulged. He pictured, with a shudder, meeting her unexpectedly on
      the uncertain plank sidewalk of Fort Erie, he smoking a cigar. When this
      nightmare presented itself to him, he resolved never to touch a cigar
      again; but he well knew that the best resolutions fade away if a man is
      excited with two or three glasses of liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Bartlett resumed conversation with the professor, Yates looked
      up at young Hiram and winked. The boy flushed with pleasure under the
      comprehensiveness of that wink. It included him in the attractive halo of
      crime that enveloped the fascinating personality of the man from New York.
      It seemed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, but we are men of the world. <i>We</i> know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Hiram&rsquo;s devotion to the Goddess Nicotine had never reached the
      altitude of a cigar. He had surreptitiously smoked a pipe in a secluded
      corner behind the barn in days when his father was away. He feared both
      his father and his mother, and so was in an even more embarrassing
      situation than old Hiram himself. He had worked gradually up to tobacco by
      smoking cigarettes of cane made from abandoned hoop-skirts. Crinoline was
      fashionable, even in the country, in those days, and ribs of cane were
      used before the metallic distenders of dresses came in. One hoop-skirt,
      whose usefulness as an article of adornment was gone, would furnish
      delight and smoking material for a company of boys for a month. The cane
      smoke made the tongue rather raw, but the wickedness was undeniable.
      Yates&rsquo; wink seemed to recognize young Hiram as a comrade worthy to offer
      incense at the shrine, and the boy was a firm friend of Yates from the
      moment the eyelid of the latter drooped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea things having been cleared away, Yates got no more glimpses of the
      girl through the open door. He rose from his lowly seat and strolled
      toward the gate, with his hands in his pockets. He remembered that he had
      forgotten something, and cudgeled his brains to make out what it was. He
      gazed down the road at the house of the Howards, which naturally brought
      to his recollection his meeting with the young girl on the road. There was
      a pang of discomfiture in this thought when he remembered the
      accomplishments attributed to her by Mrs. Bartlett. He recalled his
      condescending tone to her, and recollected his anxiety about the jar. The
      jar! That was what he had forgotten. He flashed a glance at old Hiram, and
      noted that the farmer was looking at him with something like reproach in
      his eyes. Yates moved his head almost imperceptibly toward the barn, and
      the farmer&rsquo;s eyes dropped to the floor of the veranda. The young man
      nonchalantly strolled past the end of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll go to look after the horses,&rdquo; said the farmer, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horses are all right, father. I saw to them,&rdquo; put in his son, but the
      old man frowned him down, and slouched around the corner of the house.
      Mrs. Bartlett was too busy talking to the professor to notice. So good a
      listener did not fall to her lot every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s looking at you,&rdquo; said Yates, strolling into the barn, taking a
      telescopic metal cup from his pocket, and clinking it into receptive shape
      by a jerk of the hand. He offered the now elongated cup to Hiram, who
      declined any such modern improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help yourself in that thing. The jug&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three fingers&rdquo; of the liquid gurgled out into the patented vessel, and
      the farmer took the jar, after a furtive look over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s luck.&rdquo; The newspaper man tossed off the potion with the
      facility of long experience, shutting up the dish with his thumb and
      finger, as if it were a metallic opera hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer drank silently from the jar itself. Then he smote in the cork
      with his open palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better bury it in the wheat bin,&rdquo; he said morosely. &ldquo;The boy might find
      it if you put it among the oats&mdash;feedin&rsquo; the horses, ye know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty good place,&rdquo; assented Yates, as the golden grain flowed in a wave
      over the submerged jar. &ldquo;I say, old man, you know the spot; you&rsquo;ve been
      here before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett&rsquo;s lowering countenance indicated resentment at the imputation,
      but he neither affirmed nor denied. Yates strolled out of the barn, while
      the farmer went through a small doorway that led to the stable. A moment
      later he heard Hiram calling loudly to his son to bring the pails and
      water the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently preparing an <i>alibi</i>,&rdquo; said Yates, smiling to himself, as
      he sauntered toward the gate.

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; cried Yates drowsily next morning, as a prolonged
      hammering at his door awakened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>you&rsquo;re</i> not, anyhow.&rdquo; He recognized the voice of young Hiram.
      &ldquo;I say, breakfast&rsquo;s ready. The professor has been up an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll be down shortly,&rdquo; said Yates, yawning, adding to himself:
      &ldquo;Hang the professor!&rdquo; The sun was streaming in through the east window,
      but Yates never before remembered seeing it such a short distance above
      the horizon in the morning. He pulled his watch from the pocket of his
      vest, hanging on the bedpost. It was not yet seven o&rsquo;clock. He placed it
      to his ear, thinking it had stopped, but found himself mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an unearthly hour,&rdquo; he said, unable to check the yawns. Yates&rsquo; years
      on a morning newspaper had made seven o&rsquo;clock something like midnight to
      him. He had been unable to sleep until after two o&rsquo;clock, his usual time
      of turning in, and now this rude wakening seemed thoughtless cruelty.
      However, he dressed, and yawned himself downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all seated at breakfast when Yates entered the apartment, which
      was at once dining room and parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting for you,&rdquo; said young Hiram humorously, that being one of a set of
      jokes which suited various occasions. Yates took his place near Miss
      Kitty, who looked as fresh and radiant as a spirit of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t kept you waiting long.&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett. &ldquo;If breakfast&rsquo;s a minute later than seven
      o&rsquo;clock, we soon hear of it from the men-folks. They get precious hungry
      by that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that time?&rdquo; echoed Yates. &ldquo;Then do they get up before seven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws! what a farmer you would make, Mr. Yates!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bartlett,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, everything&rsquo;s done about the house and barn; horses fed, cows milked&mdash;everything.
      There never was a better motto made than the one you learned when you were
      a boy, and like as not have forgotten all about:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Early to bed and early to rise
  Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t believe in it, Mr. Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Yates with some loftiness; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to
      see a man get out a morning paper on such a basis. I&rsquo;m healthy enough,
      quite as wealthy as the professor here, and everyone will admit that I&rsquo;m
      wiser than he is; yet I never go to bed until after two o&rsquo;clock, and
      rarely wake before noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty laughed at this, and young Hiram looked admiringly at the New
      Yorker, wishing he was as clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett, with true feminine profanity,
      &ldquo;What do you do up so late as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writing, writing,&rdquo; said Yates airily; &ldquo;articles that make dynasties
      tremble next morning, and which call forth apologies or libel suits
      afterward, as the case may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Hiram had no patience with one&rsquo;s profession as a topic of
      conversation. The tent and its future position was the burning question
      with him. He mumbled something about Yates having slept late in order to
      avoid the hearing of the words of thankfulness at the beginning of the
      meal. What his parents caught of this remark should have shown them how
      evil communications corrupt good manners; for, big as he was, the boy had
      never before ventured even to hint at ridicule on such a subject. He was
      darkly frowned upon by his silent father, and sharply reprimanded by his
      voluble mother. Kitty apparently thought it rather funny, and would like
      to have laughed. As it was, she contented herself with a sly glance at
      Yates, who, incredible as it may seem, actually blushed at young Hiram&rsquo;s
      allusion to the confusing incident of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor, who was a kind-hearted man, drew a herring across the
      scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bartlett has been good enough,&rdquo; said he, changing the subject, &ldquo;to
      say we may camp in the woods at the back of the farm. I have been out
      there this morning, and it certainly is a lovely spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re awfully obliged, Mr. Bartlett,&rdquo; said Yates. &ldquo;Of course Renmark went
      out there merely to show the difference between the ant and the butterfly.
      You&rsquo;ll find out what a humbug he is by and by, Mrs. Bartlett. He looks
      honest; but you wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know just the spot for the tent,&rdquo; cried young Hiram&mdash;&ldquo;down in the
      hollow by the creek. Then you won&rsquo;t need to haul water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and catch their deaths of fever and ague,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bartlett.
      Malaria had not then been invented. &ldquo;Take my advice, and put your tent&mdash;if
      you <i>will</i> put it up at all&mdash;on the highest ground you can find.
      Hauling water won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, Mrs. Bartlett. It shall be so. My friend uses no water&mdash;you
      ought to have seen his bill at the Buffalo hotel. I have it somewhere, and
      am going to pin it up on the outside of the tent as a warning to the youth
      of this neighborhood&mdash;and what water I need I can easily carry up
      from the creek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor did not defend himself, and Mrs. Bartlett evidently took a
      large discount from all that Yates said. She was a shrewd woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the men went out to the barn. The horses were hitched to
      the wagon, which still contained the tent and fittings. Young Hiram threw
      an ax and a spade among the canvas folds, mounted to his place, and drove
      up the lane leading to the forest, followed by Yates and Renmark on foot,
      leaving the farmer in his barnyard with a cheery good-by, which he did not
      see fit to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a field of wheat; next, an expanse of waving hay that soon would be
      ready for the scythe; then, a pasture field, in which some young horses
      galloped to the fence, gazing for a moment at the harnessed horses,
      whinnying sympathetically, off the next with flying heels wildly flung in
      the air, rejoicing in their own contrast of liberty, standing at the
      farther corner and snorting defiance to all the world; last, the cool
      shade of the woods into which the lane ran, losing its identity as a wagon
      road in diverging cow paths. Young Hiram knew the locality well, and drove
      direct to an ideal place for camping. Yates was enchanted. He included all
      that section of the country in a sweeping wave of his hand, and burst
      forth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;This is the spot, the center of the grove:
  There stands the oak, the monarch of the wood.
  In such a place as this, at such an hour,
  We&rsquo;ll raise a tent to ward off sun and shower.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare improved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Renmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit it. Couldn&rsquo;t be a better camping ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know that. I picked it out two hours ago. But you were wrong in
      your quotation. It is not by Shakespeare and yourself, as you seem to
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? Some other fellow, eh? Well, if Shake is satisfied, I am. Do
      you know, Renny, I calculate that, line for line, I&rsquo;ve written about ten
      times as much as Shakespeare. Do the literati recognize that fact? Not a
      bit of it. This is an ungrateful world, Stilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, Dick. Now, what are you going to do toward putting up the tent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, my boy, everything. I know more about putting up tents than
      you do about science, or whatever you teach. Now, Hiram, my boy, you cut
      me some stakes about two feet long&mdash;stout ones. Here, professor,
      throw off that coat and <i>négligé</i> manner, and grasp this spade. I
      want some trenches dug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates certainly made good his words. He understood the putting up of
      tents, his experience in the army being not yet remote. Young Hiram gazed
      with growing admiration at Yates&rsquo; deftness and evident knowledge of what
      he was about, while his contempt for the professor&rsquo;s futile struggle with
      a spade entangled in tree roots was hardly repressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better give me that spade,&rdquo; he said at length; but there was an element
      of stubbornness in Renmark&rsquo;s character. He struggled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the work was completed, stakes driven, ropes tightened, trenches
      dug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates danced, and gave the war whoop of the country.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Thus the canvas tent has risen,
  All the slanting stakes are driven,
  Stakes of oak and stakes of beechwood:
  Mops his brow, the tired professor;
  Grins with satisfaction, Hiram;
  Dances wildly, the reporter&mdash;
  Calls aloud for gin and water.
</pre>
    <p>
      Longfellow, old man, Longfellow. Bet you a dollar on it!&rdquo; And the
      frivolous Yates poked the professor in the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;I can stand only a certain amount of this
      sort of thing. I don&rsquo;t wish to call any man a fool, but you act remarkably
      like one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mealy-mouthed, Renny; call a spade a spade. By George! young
      Hiram has gone off and forgotten his&mdash;And the ax, too! Perhaps
      they&rsquo;re left for us. He&rsquo;s a good fellow, is young Hiram. A fool? Of course
      I&rsquo;m a fool. That&rsquo;s what I came for, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to be for
      the next two weeks. &lsquo;A fool&mdash;a fool, I met a fool i&rsquo; the forest&rsquo;&mdash;just
      the spot for him. Who could be wise here after years of brick and mortar?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your eyes, Renny,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t grow wild when you
      look around you? See the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves;
      listen to the murmur of the wind in the branches; hear the trickle of the
      brook down there; notice the smooth bark of the beech and the rugged
      covering of the oak; smell the wholesome woodland scents. Renmark, you
      have no soul, or you could not be so unmoved. It is like paradise. It is&mdash;Say,
      Renny, by Jove, I&rsquo;ve forgotten that jug at the barn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be left there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it? Oh, well, if you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do say so. I looked around for it this morning to smash it, but
      couldn&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you ask old Bartlett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; but he didn&rsquo;t know where it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates threw himself down on the moss and laughed, flinging his arms and
      legs about with the joy of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Culture, have you got any old disreputable clothes with you? Well,
      then, go into the tent and put them on; then come out and lie on your back
      and look up at the leaves. You&rsquo;re a good fellow, Renny, but decent clothes
      spoil you. You won&rsquo;t know yourself when you get ancient duds on your back.
      Old clothes mean freedom, liberty, all that our ancestors fought for. When
      you come out, we&rsquo;ll settle who&rsquo;s to cook and who to wash dishes. I&rsquo;ve
      settled it already in my own mind, but I am not so selfish as to refuse to
      discuss the matter with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the professor came out of the tent, Yates roared. Renmark himself
      smiled; he knew the effect would appeal to Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! old man, I ought to have included a mirror in the outfit. The
      look of learned respectability, set off with the garments of a
      disreputable tramp, makes a combination that is simply killing. Well, you
      can&rsquo;t spoil <i>that</i> suit, anyhow. Now sprawl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very comfortable standing up, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down on your back. You hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo; asked Yates, sitting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Renny, beware. I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive you for once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your head be it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my back, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not bad, Renny,&rdquo; cried Yates, springing to his feet. &ldquo;Now, it will
      hurt. You have fair warning. I have spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men took sparring attitudes. Yates tried to do it gently at
      first, but, finding he could not touch his opponent, struck out more
      earnestly, again giving a friendly warning. This went on ineffectually for
      some time, when the professor, with a quick movement, swung around his
      foot with the airy grace of a dancing master, and caught Yates just behind
      the knee, at the same time giving him a slight tap on the breast. Yates
      was instantly on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Renny, that wasn&rsquo;t fair. That was a kick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t. It is merely a little French touch. I learned it in Paris.
      They <i>do</i> kick there, you know; and it is good to know how to use
      your feet as well as your fists if you are set on by three, as I was one
      night in the Latin Quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Renmark; when were you in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates gazed at him for a few moments, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Renny, you improve on acquaintance. I never saw a Bool-var in my life.
      You must teach me that little kick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said Renmark, sitting down, while the other sprawled at
      full length. &ldquo;Teaching is my business, and I shall be glad to exercise any
      talents I may have in that line. In endeavoring to instruct a New York man
      the first step is to convince him that he doesn&rsquo;t know everything. That is
      the difficult point. Afterward everything is easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stillson Renmark, you are pleased to be severe. Know that you are
      forgiven. This delicious sylvan retreat does not lend itself to
      acrimonious dispute, or, in plain English, quarreling. Let dogs delight,
      if they want to; I refuse to be goaded by your querulous nature into
      giving anything but the soft answer. Now to business. Nothing is so
      conducive to friendship, when two people are camping out, as a definition
      of the duties of each at the beginning. Do you follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly. What do you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose that you do the cooking and I wash the dishes. We will forage
      for food alternate days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I agree to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard Yates sat suddenly upright, looking at his friend with reproach in
      his eyes. &ldquo;See here, Renmark; are you resolved to force on an
      international complication the very first day? That&rsquo;s no fair show to give
      a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, agreeing with him. There are depths of meanness in your character,
      Renny, that I never suspected. You know that people who camp out always
      object to the part assigned them by their fellow-campers. I counted on
      that. I&rsquo;ll do anything but wash dishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because any sane man would have said &lsquo;no&rsquo; when I suggested cooking,
      merely <i>because</i> I suggested it. There is no diplomacy about you,
      Renmark. A man doesn&rsquo;t know where to find you when you act like that. When
      you refused to do the cooking, I would have said: &lsquo;Very well, then, I&rsquo;ll
      do it,&rsquo; and everything would have been lovely; but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates lay down again in disgust. There are moments in life when language
      fails a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled that you do the cooking and I wash the dishes?&rdquo; said
      the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settled? Oh yes, if you say so; but all the pleasure of getting one&rsquo;s own
      way by the use of one&rsquo;s brains is gone. I hate to be agreed with in that
      objectionably civil manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that point being arranged, who begins the foraging&mdash;you or I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, Herr Professor, both. I propose to go to the house of the Howards,
      and I need an excuse for the first visit; therefore I shall forage to a
      limited extent. I go ostensibly for bread. As I may not get any, you
      perhaps should bring some from whatever farmhouse you choose as the scene
      of your operations. Bread is always handy in the camp, fresh or stale.
      When in doubt, buy more bread. You can never go wrong, and the bread
      won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else should I get? Milk, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; eggs, butter&mdash;anything. Mrs. Bartlett will give you hints
      on what to get that will be more valuable than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you all the cooking utensils you need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. The villain from whom I hired the outfit said it was
      complete. Doubtless he lied; but we&rsquo;ll manage, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. If you wait until I change my clothes, I&rsquo;ll go with you as far
      as the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, be advised, and don&rsquo;t change. You&rsquo;ll get everything
      twenty per cent. cheaper in that rig-out. Besides, you are so much more
      picturesque. Your costume may save us from starvation if we run short of
      cash. You can get enough for both of us as a professional tramp. Oh, well,
      if you insist, I&rsquo;ll wait. Good advice is thrown away on a man like you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret Howard stood at the kitchen table kneading dough. The room was
      called the kitchen, which it was not, except in winter. The stove was
      moved out in spring to a lean-to, easily reached through the open door
      leading to the kitchen veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the stove went out or came in, it marked the approach or the
      departure of summer. It was the heavy pendulum whose swing this way or
      that indicated the two great changes of the year. No job about the farm
      was so much disliked by the farmer and his boys as the semiannual removal
      of the stove. Soot came down, stovepipes gratingly grudged to go together
      again; the stove was heavy and cumbersome, and many a pain in a rural back
      dated from the journey of the stove from outhouse to kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen itself was a one-story building, which projected back from the
      two-story farmhouse, giving the whole a T-shape. There was a veranda on
      each side of the kitchen, as well as one along the front of the house
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s sleeves were turned back nearly to her elbows, showing a pair
      of white and shapely arms. Now and then she deftly dusted the kneading
      board with flour to prevent the dough sticking, and as she pressed her
      open palms into the smooth, white, spongy mass, the table groaned
      protestingly. She cut the roll with a knife into lumps that were patted
      into shape, and placed side by side, like hillocks of snow, in the
      sheet-iron pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a rap at the open kitchen door, and Margaret
      turned round, startled, for visitors were rare at that hour of the day;
      besides, neighbors seldom made such a concession to formality as to knock.
      The young girl flushed as she recognized the man who had spoken to her the
      day before. He stood smiling in the doorway, with his hat in his hand. She
      uttered no word of greeting or welcome, but stood looking at him, with her
      hand on the floury table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Miss Howard,&rdquo; said Yates blithely; &ldquo;may I come in? I have
      been knocking for some time fruitlessly at the front door, so I took the
      liberty of coming around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hear you knock,&rdquo; answered Margaret. She neglected to invite him
      in, but he took the permission for granted and entered, seating himself as
      one who had come to stay. &ldquo;You must excuse me for going on with my work,&rdquo;
       she added; &ldquo;bread at this stage will not wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly. Please do not let me interrupt you. I have made my
      own bread for years, but not in that way. I am glad that you are making
      bread, for I have come to see if I can buy some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Perhaps I can sell you some butter and eggs as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates laughed in that joyous, free-hearted manner of his which had much to
      do with his getting on in the world. It was difficult to remain long angry
      with so buoyant a nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss Howard, I see you haven&rsquo;t forgiven me for that remark. You
      surely could not have thought I meant it. I really intended it for a joke,
      but I am willing to admit, now that I look back on it, that the joke was
      rather poor; but, then, most of my jokes are rather shopworn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I lack a sense of humor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All women do,&rdquo; said Yates with easy confidence. &ldquo;At least, all I&rsquo;ve ever
      met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates was sitting in a wooden chair, which he now placed at the end of the
      table, tilting it back until his shoulders rested against the wall. His
      feet were upon the rung, and he waved his hat back and forth, fanning
      himself, for it was warm. In this position he could look up at the face of
      the pretty girl before him, whose smooth brow was touched with just the
      slightest indication of a faint frown. She did not even glance at the
      self-confident young man, but kept her eyes fixed resolutely on her work.
      In the silence the table creaked as Margaret kneaded the dough. Yates felt
      an unaccustomed sensation of embarrassment creeping over him, and realized
      that he would have to re-erect the conversation on a new basis. It was
      manifestly absurd that a resourceful New Yorker, who had conversed
      unabashed with presidents, senators, generals, and other great people of a
      great nation, should be put out of countenance by the unaccountable
      coldness of a country girl in the wilds of Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not had an opportunity of properly introducing myself,&rdquo; he said at
      last, when the creaking of the table, slight as it was, became
      insupportable. &ldquo;My name is Richard Yates, and I come from New York. I am
      camping out in this neighborhood to relieve, as it were, a mental strain&mdash;the
      result of years of literary work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates knew from long experience that the quickest and surest road to a
      woman&rsquo;s confidence was through her sympathy. &ldquo;Mental strain&rdquo; struck him as
      a good phrase, indicating midnight oil and the hollow eye of the devoted
      student.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your work mental, then?&rdquo; asked Margaret incredulously, flashing, for
      the first time, a dark-eyed look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Yates laughed uneasily. He had manifestly missed fire. &ldquo;I notice by
      your tone that you evidently think my equipment meager. You should not
      judge by appearances, Miss Howard. Most of us are better than we seem,
      pessimists to the contrary notwithstanding. Well, as I was saying, the
      camping company consists of two partners. We are so different in every
      respect that we are the best of friends. My partner is Mr. Stillson
      Renmark, professor of something or other in University College, Toronto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Margaret exhibited some interest in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Renmark? I have heard of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I had no idea the fame of the professor had penetrated beyond
      the precincts of the university&mdash;if a university has precincts. He
      told me it had all the modern improvements, but I suspected at the time
      that was merely Renny&rsquo;s brag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frown on the girl&rsquo;s brow deepened, and Yates was quick to see that he
      had lost ground again, if, indeed, he had ever gained any, which he began
      to doubt. She evidently did not relish his glib talk about the university.
      He was just about to say something deferentially about that institution,
      for he was not a man who would speak disrespectfully of the equator if he
      thought he might curry favor with his auditor by doing otherwise, when it
      occurred to him that Miss Howard&rsquo;s interest was centered in the man, and
      not in the university.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this world, Miss Howard,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;true merit rarely finds its
      reward; at least, the reward shows some reluctance in making itself
      visible in time for man to enjoy it. Professor Renmark is a man so worthy
      that I was rather astonished to learn that you knew of him. I am glad for
      his sake that it is so, for no man more thoroughly deserves fame than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of him,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;except what my brother has
      written. My brother is a student at the university.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he really? And what is he going in for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is an all-round handy thing for a person to have about him. I
      often wish I had had a university training. Still, it is not valued in an
      American newspaper office as much as might be. Yet,&rdquo; he added in a tone
      that showed he did not desire to be unfair to a man of education, &ldquo;I have
      known some university men who became passably good reporters in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl made no answer, but attended strictly to the work in hand. She
      had the rare gift of silence, and these intervals of quiet abashed Yates,
      whose most frequent boast was that he could outtalk any man on earth.
      Opposition, or even abuse, merely served as a spur to his volubility, but
      taciturnity disconcerted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried at length, with something like desperation, &ldquo;let us
      abandon this animated discussion on the subject of education, and take up
      the more practical topic of bread. Would you believe, Miss Howard, that I
      am an expert in bread making?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you said already that you made your bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, but I meant then that I made it by the sweat of my good lead
      pencil. Still, I have made bread in my time, and I believe that some of
      those who subsisted upon it are alive to-day. The endurance of the human
      frame is something marvelous, when you come to think of it. I did the
      baking in a lumber camp one winter. Used to dump the contents of a sack of
      flour into a trough made out of a log, pour in a pail or two of melted
      snow, and mix with a hoe after the manner of a bricklayer&rsquo;s assistant
      making mortar. There was nothing small or mean about my bread making. I
      was in the wholesale trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pity the unfortunate lumbermen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sympathy is entirely misplaced, Miss Howard. You ought to pity me
      for having to pander to such appetites as those men brought in from the
      woods with them. They never complained of the quality of the bread,
      although there was occasionally some grumbling about the quantity. I have
      fed sheaves to a threshing machine and logs to a sawmill, but their
      voracity was nothing to that of a big lumberman just in from felling
      trees. Enough, and plenty of it, is what he wants. No &lsquo;tabbledote&rsquo; for
      him. He wants it all at once, and he wants it right away. If there is any
      washing necessary, he is content to do it after the meal. I know nothing,
      except a morning paper, that has such an appetite for miscellaneous stuff
      as the man of the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl made no remark, but Yates could see that she was interested in
      his talk in spite of herself. The bread was now in the pans, and she had
      drawn out the table to the middle of the floor; the baking board had
      disappeared, and the surface of the table was cleaned. With a light, deft
      motion of her two hands she had whisked over its surface the spotlessly
      white cloth, which flowed in waves over the table and finally settled
      calmly in its place like the placid face of a pond in the moonlight. Yates
      realized that the way to success lay in keeping the conversation in his
      own hands and not depending on any response. In this way a man may best
      display the store of knowledge he possesses, to the admiration and
      bewilderment of his audience, even though his store consists merely of
      samples like the outfit of a commercial traveler; yet a commercial
      traveler who knows his business can so arrange his samples on the table of
      his room in a hotel that they give the onlooker an idea of the vastness
      and wealth of the warehouses from which they are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bread,&rdquo; said Yates with the serious air of a very learned man, &ldquo;is a most
      interesting subject. It is a historical subject&mdash;it is a biblical
      subject. As an article of food it is mentioned oftener in the Bible than
      any other. It is used in parable and to point a moral. &lsquo;Ye must not live
      on bread alone.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the suspicion of a twinkle in the eye of his listener he feared he
      had not quoted correctly. He knew he was not now among that portion of his
      samples with which he was most familiar, so he hastened back to the
      historical aspect of his subject. Few people could skate over thinner ice
      than Richard Yates, but his natural shrewdness always caused him to return
      to more solid footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, in this country bread has gone through three distinct stages, and
      although I am a strong believer in progress, yet, in the case of our most
      important article of food, I hold that the bread of to-day is inferior to
      the bread our mothers used to make, or perhaps, I should say, our
      grandmothers. This is, unfortunately, rapidly becoming the age of
      machinery&mdash;and machinery, while it may be quicker, is certainly not
      so thorough as old-fashioned hand work. There is a new writer in England
      named Ruskin who is very bitter against machinery. He would like to see it
      abolished&mdash;at least, so he says. I will send for one of his books,
      and show it to you, if you will let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, in New York, surely do not call the author of &lsquo;Modern Painters&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&rsquo; a new man. My father has one of his
      books which must be nearly twenty years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the longest speech Margaret had made to him, and, as he said
      afterward to the professor in describing its effects, it took him right
      off his feet. He admitted to the professor, but not to the girl, that he
      had never read a word of Ruskin in his life. The allusion he had made to
      him he had heard someone else use, and he had worked it into an article
      before now with telling effect. &ldquo;As Mr. Ruskin says&rdquo; looked well in a
      newspaper column, giving an air of erudition and research to it. Mr.
      Yates, however, was not at the present moment prepared to enter into a
      discussion on either the age or the merits of the English writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;technically speaking, of course, Ruskin is not a new
      man. What I meant was that he is looked on&mdash;ah&mdash;in New York as&mdash;that
      is&mdash;you know&mdash;as comparatively new&mdash;comparatively new. But,
      as I was saying about bread, the old log-house era of bread, as I might
      call it, produced the most delicious loaf ever made in this country. It
      was the salt-rising kind, and was baked in a round, flat-bottomed iron
      kettle. Did you ever see the baking kettle of other days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Mrs. Bartlett has one, although she never uses it now. It was
      placed on the hot embers, was it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Yates, noting with pleasure that the girl was thawing, as
      he expressed it to himself. &ldquo;The hot coals were drawn out and the kettle
      placed upon them. When the lid was in position, hot coals were put on he
      top of it. The bread was firm and white and sweet inside, with the most
      delicious golden brown crust all around. Ah, that was bread! but perhaps I
      appreciated it because I was always hungry in those days. Then came the
      alleged improvement of the tin Dutch oven. That was the second stage in
      the evolution of bread in this country. It also belonged to the log-house
      and open-fireplace era. Bread baked by direct heat from the fire and
      reflected heat from the polished tin. I think our present cast-iron stove
      arrangement is preferable to that, although not up to the old-time
      kettle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Margaret had been a reader of the New York <i>Argus</i>, she would have
      noticed that the facts set forth by her visitor had already appeared in
      that paper, much elaborated, in an article entitled &ldquo;Our Daily Bread.&rdquo; In
      the pause that ensued after Yates had finished his dissertation on the
      staff of life the stillness was broken by a long wailing cry. It began
      with one continued, sustained note, and ended with a wail half a tone
      below the first. The girl paid no attention to it, but Yates started to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of&mdash;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret smiled, but before she could answer the stillness was again
      broken by what appeared to be the more distant notes of a bugle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was Kitty Bartlett&rsquo;s voice calling the men home
      from the field for dinner. Mrs. Bartlett is a very good housekeeper and is
      usually a few minutes ahead of the neighbors with the meals. The second
      was the sound of a horn farther up the road. It is what you would deplore
      as the age of tin applied to the dinner call, just as your tin oven
      supplanted the better bread maker. I like Kitty&rsquo;s call much better than
      the tin horn. It seems to me more musical, although it appeared to startle
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can talk!&rdquo; cried Yates with audacious admiration, at which the
      girl colored slightly and seemed to retire within herself again. &ldquo;And you
      can make fun of people&rsquo;s historical lore, too. Which do you use&mdash;the
      tin horn or the natural voice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither. If you will look outside, you will see a flag at the top of a
      pole. That is our signal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It flashed across the mind of Yates that this was intended as an
      intimation that he might see many things outside to interest him. He felt
      that his visit had not been at all the brilliant success he had
      anticipated. Of course the quest for bread had been merely an excuse. He
      had expected to be able to efface the unfavorable impression he knew he
      had made by his jaunty conversation on the Ridge Road the day before, and
      he realized that his position was still the same. A good deal of Yates&rsquo; 
      success in life came from the fact that he never knew when he was beaten.
      He did not admit defeat now, but he saw he had, for some reason, not
      gained any advantage in a preliminary skirmish. He concluded it would be
      well to retire in good order, and renew the contest at some future time.
      He was so unused to anything like a rebuff that all his fighting qualities
      were up in arms, and he resolved to show this unimpressionable girl that
      he was not a man to be lightly valued.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rose the door from the main portion of the house opened, and there
      entered a woman hardly yet past middle age, who had once been undoubtedly
      handsome, but on whose worn and faded face was the look of patient
      weariness which so often is the result of a youth spent in helping a
      husband to overcome the stumpy stubbornness of an American bush farm. When
      the farm is conquered, the victor is usually vanquished. It needed no
      second glance to see that she was the mother from whom the daughter had
      inherited her good looks. Mrs. Howard did not appear surprised to see a
      stranger standing there; in fact, the faculty of being surprised at
      anything seemed to have left her. Margaret introduced them quietly, and
      went about her preparation for the meal. Yates greeted Mrs. Howard with
      effusion. He had come, he said, on a bread mission. He thought he knew
      something about bread, but he now learned he came too early in the day. He
      hoped he might have the privilege of repeating his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not going now?&rdquo; said Mrs. Howard with hospitable anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I have already stayed too long,&rdquo; answered Yates lingeringly. &ldquo;My
      partner, Professor Renmark, is also on a foraging expedition at your
      neighbors&rsquo;, the Bartletts. He is doubtless back in camp long ago, and will
      be expecting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of that. Mrs. Bartlett would never let anyone go when there is a
      meal on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I shall be giving extra trouble by staying. I imagine there
      is quite enough to do in every farmhouse without entertaining any chance
      tramp who happens along. Don&rsquo;t you agree with me for once, Miss Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates was reluctant to go, and yet he did not wish to stay unless Margaret
      added her invitation to her mother&rsquo;s. He felt vaguely that his reluctance
      did him credit, and that he was improving. He could not remember a time
      when he had not taken without question whatever the gods sent, and this
      unaccustomed qualm of modesty caused him to suspect that there were depths
      in his nature hitherto unexplored. It always flatters a man to realize
      that he is deeper than he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Howard laughed in a subdued manner because Yates likened himself to a
      tramp, and Margaret said coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s motto is that one more or less never makes any difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your motto, Miss Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Margaret has any,&rdquo; said Mrs. Howard, answering for her
      daughter. &ldquo;She is like her father. She reads a great deal and doesn&rsquo;t talk
      much. He would read all the time, if he did not have to work. I see
      Margaret has already invited you, for she has put an extra plate on the
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;I shall have much pleasure in accepting both the
      verbal and the crockery invitation. I am sorry for the professor at his
      lonely meal by the tent; for he is a martyr to duty, and I feel sure Mrs.
      Bartlett will not be able to keep him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mrs. Howard could reply there floated in to them, from the outside,
      where Margaret was, a cheery voice which Yates had no difficulty in
      recognizing as belonging to Miss Kitty Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Margaret!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know whom I mean. That conceited city fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently an admonition and a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care if he does. I&rsquo;ll tell him so to his face. It might do
      him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next moment there appeared a pretty vision in the doorway. On the fair
      curls, which were flying about her shoulders, had been carelessly placed
      her brother&rsquo;s straw hat, with a broad and torn brim. Her face was flushed
      with running; and of the fact that she was a very lovely girl there was
      not the slightest doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How de do?&rdquo; she said to Mrs. Howard, and, nodding to Yates, cried: &ldquo;I
      knew you were here, but I came over to make sure. There&rsquo;s going to be war
      in our house. Mother&rsquo;s made a prisoner of the professor already, but he
      doesn&rsquo;t know it. He thinks he&rsquo;s going back to the tent, and she&rsquo;s packing
      up the things he wanted, and doing it awfully slow, till I get back. He
      said you would be sure to be waiting for him out in the woods. We both
      told him there was no fear of that. You wouldn&rsquo;t leave a place where there
      was good cooking for all the professors in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wonderful judge of character, Miss Bartlett,&rdquo; said Yates,
      somewhat piqued by her frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am. The professor knows ever so much more than you, but he
      doesn&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;s well off, just the same. You do. He&rsquo;s a quiet,
      stubborn man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which do you admire the most, Miss Bartlett&mdash;a quiet, stubborn
      man, or one who is conceited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kitty laughed heartily, without the slightest trace of embarrassment.
      &ldquo;Detest, you mean. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Margaret, which is the most
      objectionable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret looked reproachfully at her neighbor on being thus suddenly
      questioned, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, laughing again, sprang toward her friend, dabbed a little kiss,
      like the peck of a bird, on each cheek, cried: &ldquo;Well, I must be off, or
      mother will have to tie up the professor to keep him,&rdquo; and was off
      accordingly with the speed and lightness of a young fawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary girl,&rdquo; remarked Yates, as the flutter of curls and calico
      dress disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good girl,&rdquo; cried Margaret emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, I said nothing to the contrary. But don&rsquo;t you think she is
      somewhat free with her opinions about other people?&rdquo; asked Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not know that you were within hearing when she first spoke, and
      after that she brazened it out. That&rsquo;s her way. But she&rsquo;s a kind girl and
      good-hearted, otherwise she would not have taken the trouble to come over
      here merely because your friend happened to be surly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Renny is anything but surly,&rdquo; said Yates, as quick to defend his
      friend as she was to stand up for hers. &ldquo;As I was saying a moment ago, he
      is a martyr to duty, and if he thought I was at the camp, nothing would
      keep him. Now he will have a good dinner in peace when he knows I am not
      waiting for him, and a good dinner is more than he will get when I take to
      the cooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the silent signal on the flagpole had done its work, and
      Margaret&rsquo;s father and brother arrived from the field. They put their broad
      straw hats on the roof of the kitchen veranda, and, taking water in a tin
      basin from the rain barrel, placed it on a bench outside and proceeded to
      wash vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Howard was much more interested in his guest than his daughter had
      apparently been. Yates talked glibly, as he could always do if he had a
      sympathetic audience, and he showed an easy familiarity with the great
      people of this earth that was fascinating to a man who had read much of
      them, but who was, in a measure, locked out of the bustling world. Yates
      knew many of the generals in the late war, and all of the politicians. Of
      the latter there was not an honest man among them, according to the
      reporter; of the former there were few who had not made the most ghastly
      mistakes. He looked on the world as a vast hoard of commonplace people,
      wherein the men of real genius were buried out of sight, if there were any
      men of genius, which he seemed to doubt, and those on the top were there
      either through their own intrigues or because they had been forced up by
      circumstances. His opinions sometimes caused a look of pain to cross the
      face of the older man, who was enthusiastic in his quiet way, and had his
      heroes. He would have been a strong Republican if he had lived in the
      States; and he had watched the four-years&rsquo; struggle, through the papers,
      with keen and absorbed interest. The North had been fighting, in his
      opinion, for the great and undying principle of human liberty, and had
      deservedly won. Yates had no such delusion. It was a politicians&rsquo; war, he
      said. Principle wasn&rsquo;t in it. The North would have been quite willing to
      let slavery stand if the situation had not been forced by the firing on
      Fort Sumter. Then the conduct of the war did not at all meet the approval
      of Mr. Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose Grant will go down into history as a great
      general. The truth is that he simply knew how to subtract. That is all
      there is in it. He had the additional boon of an utter lack of
      imagination. We had many generals who were greater than Grant, but they
      were troubled with imaginations. Imagination will ruin the best general in
      the world. Now, take yourself, for example. If you were to kill a man
      unintentionally, your conscience would trouble you all the rest of your
      life. Think how you would feel, then, if you were to cause the death of
      ten thousand men all in a lump. It would break you down. The mistake an
      ordinary man makes may result in the loss of a few dollars, which can be
      replaced; but if a general makes a mistake, the loss can never be made up,
      for his mistakes are estimated by the lives of men. He says &lsquo;Go&rsquo; when he
      should have said &lsquo;Come.&rsquo; He says &lsquo;Attack&rsquo; when he should have said
      &lsquo;Retreat.&rsquo; What is the result? Five, ten, or fifteen thousand men, many of
      them better men than he is, left dead on the field. Grant had nothing of
      this feeling. He simply knew how to subtract, as I said before. It is like
      this: You have fifty thousand men and I have twenty-five thousand. When I
      kill twenty-five thousand of your men and you kill twenty-five thousand of
      my men, you have twenty-five thousand left and I have none. You are the
      victor, and the thoughtless crowd howls about you, but that does not make
      you out the greatest general by a long shot. If Lee had had Grant&rsquo;s
      number, and Grant had Lee&rsquo;s, the result would have been reversed. Grant
      set himself to do this little sum in subtraction, and he did it&mdash;did
      it probably as quickly as any other man would have done it, and he knew
      that when it was done the war would have to stop. That&rsquo;s all there was to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older man shook his head. &ldquo;I doubt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if history will take
      your view either of the motives of those in power or of the way the war
      was carried on. It was a great and noble struggle, heroically fought by
      those deluded people who were in the wrong, and stubbornly contested at
      immense self-sacrifice by those who were in the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity it was,&rdquo; said young Howard to the newspaper man, with a
      rudeness that drew a frown from his father, &ldquo;that you didn&rsquo;t get to show
      &lsquo;em how to carry on the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Yates, with a humorous twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;I flatter myself
      that I would have given them some valuable pointers. Still, it is too late
      to bemoan their neglect now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you may have a chance yet,&rdquo; continued the unabashed young man. &ldquo;They
      say the Fenians are coming over here this time sure. You ought to
      volunteer either on our side or on theirs, and show how a war ought to be
      carried on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing in the Fenian scare! They won&rsquo;t venture over. They
      fight with their mouths. It&rsquo;s the safest way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said the youth significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was because the boy had been so inconsiderate as to make these
      remarks that Yates received a cordial invitation from both Mr. and Mrs.
      Howard to visit the farm as often as he cared to do so. Of this privilege
      Yates resolved to avail himself, but he would have prized it more if Miss
      Margaret had added her word&mdash;which she did not, perhaps because she
      was so busy looking after the bread. Yates knew, however, that with a
      woman apparent progress is rarely synonymous with real progress. This
      knowledge soothed his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked back to the camp he reviewed his own feelings with something
      like astonishment. The march of events was rapid even for him, who was not
      slow in anything he undertook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the result of leisure,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It is the first
      breathing time I have had for fifteen years. Not two days of my vacation
      gone, and here I am hopelessly in love!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yates had intended to call at the Bartletts&rsquo; and escort Renmark back to
      the woods; but when he got outside he forgot the existence of the
      professor, and wandered somewhat aimlessly up the side road, switching at
      the weeds that always grow in great profusion along the ditches of a
      Canadian country thoroughfare. The day was sunny and warm, and as Yates
      wandered on in the direction of the forest he thought of many things. He
      had feared that he would find life deadly dull so far from New York,
      without even the consolation of a morning-paper, the feverish reading of
      which had become a sort of vice with him, like smoking. He had imagined
      that he could not exist without his morning paper, but he now realized
      that it was not nearly so important a factor in life as he had supposed;
      yet he sighed when he thought of it, and wished he had one with him of
      current date. He could now, for the first time in many years, read a paper
      without that vague fear which always possessed him when he took up an
      opposition sheet, still damp from the press. Before he could enjoy it his
      habit was to scan it over rapidly to see if it contained any item of news
      which he himself had missed the previous day. The impending &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; hangs
      over the head of the newspaper man like the sword so often quoted. Great
      as the joy of beating the opposition press is, it never takes the
      poignancy of the sting away from a beating received. If a terrible
      disaster took place, and another paper gave fuller particulars than the <i>Argus</i>
      did, Yates found himself almost wishing the accident had not occurred,
      although he recognized such a wish as decidedly unprofessional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s idea of the correct spirit in a reporter was exemplified by an
      old broken-down, out-of-work morning newspaper man, who had not long
      before committed suicide at an hour in the day too late for the evening
      papers to get the sensational item. He had sent in to the paper for which
      he formerly worked a full account of the fatality, accurately headed and
      sub-headed; and, in his note to the city editor, he told why he had chosen
      the hour of 7 P.M. as the time for his departure from an unappreciative
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Yates under his breath, and suddenly pulling himself
      together, &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t think of New York if I intend to stay here for a
      couple of weeks. I&rsquo;ll be city-sick the first thing I know, and then I&rsquo;ll
      make a break for the metropolis. This will never do. The air here is
      enchanting, it fills a man with new life. This is the spot for me, and
      I&rsquo;ll stick to it till I&rsquo;m right again. Hang New York! But I mustn&rsquo;t think
      of Broadway or I&rsquo;m done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to the spot in the road where he could see the white side of the
      tent under the dark trees, and climbed up on the rail fence, sitting there
      for a few moments. The occasional call of a quail from a neighboring field
      was the only sound that broke the intense stillness. The warm smell of
      spring was in the air. The buds had but recently broken, and the woods,
      intensely green, had a look of newness and freshness that was comforting
      to the eye and grateful to the other senses. The world seemed to be but
      lately made. The young man breathed deeply of the vivifying air, and said:
      &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing the matter with this place, Dick. New York&rsquo;s a fool
      to it.&rdquo; Then, with a sigh, he added: &ldquo;If I can stand it for two weeks. I
      wonder how the boys are getting on without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself his thoughts kept drifting back to the great city,
      although he told himself that it wouldn&rsquo;t do. He gazed at the peaceful,
      spreading landscape, but his eyes were vacant and he saw nothing. The roar
      of the streets was in his ears. Suddenly his reverie was broken by a voice
      from the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Yates, where&rsquo;s the bread?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates looked quickly around, somewhat startled, and saw the professor
      coming toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bread? I forgot all about it. No; I didn&rsquo;t either. They were baking&mdash;that
      was it. I am to go for it later in the day. What loot did you rake in,
      professor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vegetables mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Have a good dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I. Renny, when you interrupted me, I was just counting the
      farmhouses in sight. What do you say to boarding round among them? You are
      a schoolmaster, and ought to know all about it. Isn&rsquo;t education in this
      country encouraged by paying the teacher as little as possible, and
      letting him take it out in eating his way from one house to another? Ever
      board around, Renny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. If the custom once existed in Canada, it is out of date now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity. I hate to face my own cooking, Renmark. We become less
      brave as we grow older. By the way, how is old man Bartlett? As well as
      could be expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed much as usual. Mrs. Bartlett has sent out two chairs to the
      tent; she fears we will get rheumatism if we sit on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a kind woman, Renny, and a thoughtful. And that reminds me: I have
      a hammock somewhere among my belongings. I will swing it up. Chairs are
      comfortable, but a hammock is luxury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates slid down from the fence top, and together the two men walked to the
      tent. The hammock was unfurled and slung between two trees. Yates tested
      it cautiously, and finally trusted himself to its restful folds of
      network. He was swaying indolently several feet from the ground when he
      said to Renmark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call this paradise&mdash;paradise regained; but it will be paradise
      lost next month. Now, professor, I am ready to do the cooking, but I have
      a fancy for doing it by proxy. The general directs, and the useful prosaic
      man executes. Where are your vegetables, Renny? Potatoes and carrots, eh?
      Very good. Now, you may wash them, Renny; but first you must bring some
      water from the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor was a patient man, and he obeyed. Yates continued to swing
      in the hammock alternating directions with rhapsodies on the beauties of
      the day and the stillness of the woods. Renmark said but little, and
      attended strictly to the business in hand. The vegetables finished, he
      took a book from his valise, tilted a chair back against a tree, and began
      to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m depending upon you for the bread,&rdquo; he said to the drowsy man in the
      hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are, Renny. Your confidence is not misplaced. I shall presently
      journey down into the realms of civilization, and fill the long-felt want.
      I shall go to the Howards by way of the Bartlett homestead, but I warn you
      that if there is a meal on, at either place, you will not have me here to
      test your first efforts at cooking. So you may have to wait until
      breakfast for my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates extricated himself slowly and reluctantly from the hammock, and
      looked regretfully at it when he stood once more on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This mad struggle for bread, professor, is the curse of life here below.
      It is what we are all after. If it were not for the necessity of bread and
      clothing, what a good time a fellow might have. Well, my blessing, Renny.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates strolled slowly through the woods, until he came to the beginning of
      a lane which led to the Bartlett homestead. He saw the farmer and his son
      at work in the back fields. From between the distant house and barn there
      arose, straight up into the still air, a blue column of smoke, which,
      reaching a certain height, spread out like a thin, hazy cloud above the
      dwelling. At first Yates thought that some of the outhouses were on fire,
      and he quickened his pace to a run; but a moment&rsquo;s reflection showed him
      that the column was plainly visible to the workers in the fields, and that
      if anything were wrong they would not continue placidly at their labor.
      When he had walked the long length of the lane, and had safely rounded the
      corner of the barn, he saw, in the open space between that building and
      the house, a huge camp fire blazing. From a pole, upheld by two crotched
      supports, hung a big iron kettle over the flames. The caldron was full
      nearly to the brim, and the steam was already beginning to rise from its
      surface, although the fire had evidently been but recently kindled. The
      smoke was not now so voluminous, but Kitty Bartlett stood there with a
      big-brimmed straw hat in her hands, fanning it away from her face, while
      the hat at the same time protected her rosy countenance from the fire. She
      plainly was not prepared to receive visitors, and she started when the
      young man addressed her, flushing still more deeply, apparently annoyed at
      his unwelcome appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon,&rdquo; he said cordially. &ldquo;Preparing for washing? I thought
      Monday was washing day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have not been misinformed. And you are not preparing for washing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates laughed so heartily that Kitty, in spite of herself, had to permit a
      smile to brighten her own features. She always found it difficult remain
      solemn for any length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is obviously a conundrum,&rdquo; said Yates, ticking off the items on his
      four fingers. &ldquo;First, Monday is washing day. Second, this is not Monday.
      Third, neither is to-morrow. Fourth, we are preparing for washing. I give
      it up, Miss Bartlett. Please tell me the answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer is that I am making soap; soft soap, if you know what that
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically, I don&rsquo;t know what it is; but I have heard the term used in a
      political connection. In the States we say that if a man is very
      diplomatic he uses soft soap, so I suppose it has lubricating qualities.
      Sam Slick used the term &lsquo;soft sawder&rsquo; in the same way; but what sawder is,
      soft or hard, I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you knew everything, Mr. Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Bless you, no. I&rsquo;m a humble gleaner in the field of knowledge. That&rsquo;s
      why I brought a Toronto professor with me. I want to learn something.
      Won&rsquo;t you teach me how to make soap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very busy just now. When I said that we were preparing for washing, I
      should perhaps have told you there was something else we are not prepared
      for to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A visitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Miss Bartlett, you are a little hard on me. I&rsquo;m not a visitor.
      I&rsquo;m a friend of the family. I want to help. You will find me a most
      diligent student. Won&rsquo;t you give me a chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the hard work&rsquo;s done. But perhaps you knew that before you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates looked at her reproachfully, and sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is to be a misunderstood man. So you think, among other
      bad qualities, I have the habit of shirking work? Let me tell you, Miss
      Bartlett, that the reason I am here is because I have worked too hard.
      Now, confess that you are sorry for what you said&mdash;trampling on an
      already downtrodden man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty laughed merrily at this, and Yates laughed also, for his sense of
      comradeship was strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look as if you had ever worked in your life; I don&rsquo;t believe
      you know what work is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are different kinds of labor. Don&rsquo;t you call writing work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where you&rsquo;re mistaken. It is, and hard work, too. I&rsquo;ll tell
      you about the newspaper business if you&rsquo;ll tell me about soap making. Fair
      exchange. I wish you would take me as a pupil, Miss Bartlett; you would
      find me quick at picking up things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, pick up that pail and draw a pailful of water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; cried Yates sternly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, though it blast me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates picked up the wooden pail, painted blue on the outside, with a red
      stripe near the top for ornament, and cream-colored inside. It was called
      a &ldquo;patent pail&rdquo; in those days, as it was a comparatively recent
      innovation, being cheaper, lighter, and stronger than the tin pail which
      it was rapidly replacing. At the well was a stout pole, pinned through the
      center to the upright support on which it swung, like the walking-beam of
      an engine. The thick end, which rested on the ground, was loaded with
      heavy stones; while from the thin end, high in the air, there dangled over
      the mouth of the well a slim pole with a hook. This hook was ingeniously
      furnished with a spring of hickory, which snapped when the handle of the
      pail was placed on the hook, and prevented the &ldquo;patent&rdquo; utensil from
      slipping off when it was lowered to the surface of the water. Yates
      speedily recognized the usefulness of this contrivance, for he found that
      the filling of a wooden pail in a deep well was not the simple affair it
      looked. The bucket bobbed about on the surface of the water. Once he
      forgot the necessity of keeping a stout grip on the pole, and the next
      instant the pail came up to the sunlight with a suddenness that was
      terrifying. Only an equally sudden backward jump on Yates&rsquo; part saved his
      head. Miss Bartlett was pleased to look upon this incident as funny. Yates
      was so startled by the unexpected revolt of the pail that his native
      courtesy did not get a chance to prevent Kitty from drawing up the water
      herself. She lowered the vessel, pulling down the pole in a hand-over-hand
      manner that the young man thought decidedly fetching, and then she gave an
      almost imperceptible twist to the arrangement that resulted in instant
      success. The next thing Yates knew the full pail was resting on the well
      curb, and the hickory spring had given the click that released the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Kitty, suppressing her merriment, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the result, Miss Bartlett; but I&rsquo;m not sure I can do the trick.
      These things are not so simple as they seem. What is the next step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pour the water into the leach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the leach, I said. Where else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m up a tree again. I see I don&rsquo;t even know the A B C of this
      business. In the old days the leech was a physician. You don&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m to
      drown a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the leach,&rdquo; said Kitty, pointing to a large, yellowish, upright
      wooden cylinder, which rested on some slanting boards, down the surface of
      which ran a brownish liquid that dripped into a trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Yates stood on a bench with the pail in his hand he saw that the
      cylinder was filled nearly to the top with sodden wood ashes. He poured in
      the water, and it sank quickly out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is part of the soap-making equipment?&rdquo; he said, stepping down; &ldquo;I
      thought the iron kettle over the fire was the whole factory. Tell me about
      the leach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where the hard work of soap making comes in,&rdquo; said Kitty,
      stirring the contents of the iron kettle with a long stick. &ldquo;Keeping the
      leach supplied with water at first is no fun, for then the ashes are dry.
      If you put in five more pails of water, I will tell you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; cried Yates, pleased to see that the girl&rsquo;s evident objection to
      his presence at first was fast disappearing. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll understand how
      energetic I am. I&rsquo;m a handy man about a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had completed his task, she was still stirring the thickening
      liquid in the caldron, guarding her face from the fire with her big straw
      hat. Her clustering, tangled fair hair was down about her shoulders; and
      Yates, as he put the pail in its place, when it had been emptied the fifth
      time, thought she formed a very pretty picture standing there by the fire,
      even if she were making soft soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wicked genii has finished the task set him by the fairy princess. Now
      for the reward. I want all the particulars about the leach. In the first
      place, where do you get this huge wooden cylinder that I have, without
      apparent effect, been pouring water into? Is it manufactured or natural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both. It is a section of the buttonwood tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buttonwood? I don&rsquo;t think I ever heard of that. I know the beech and the
      maple, and some kinds of oak, but there my wood lore ends. Why the
      buttonwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The buttonwood happens to be exactly suited to the purpose. It is a tree
      that is very fine to look at. It seems all right, but it generally isn&rsquo;t.
      It is hollow or rotten within, and, even when sound, the timber made from
      it is of little value, as it doesn&rsquo;t last. Yet you can&rsquo;t tell until you
      begin to chop whether it is of any use or not.&rdquo; Kitty shot a quick glance
      at the young man, who was sitting on a log watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Miss Bartlett; I see what you mean. There are men like the
      buttonwood tree. The woods are full of them. I&rsquo;ve met lots of that kind,
      fair to look upon, but hollow. Of course you don&rsquo;t mean anything personal;
      for you must have seen my worth by the way I stuck to the water hauling.
      But go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, I never thought of such a thing; but a guilty conscience, they
      say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Kitty, with a giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they say; but it&rsquo;s wrong, like most other things they say. It&rsquo;s
      the man with the guilty conscience who looks you straight in the eye. Now
      that the buttonwood is chopped down, what&rsquo;s the next thing to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sawn off at the proper length, square at one end and slanting at
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why slanting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, the foundation of plank on which it rests is inclined, so
      the end of the leach that is down must be slantingly cut, otherwise it
      would not stand perpendicularly. It would topple over in the first
      windstorm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see. Then they haul it in and set it up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no; not yet. They build a fire in it when it gets dry enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? I think I understand the comprehensive scheme, but I slip up on
      the details, as when I tried to submerge that wooden pail. What&rsquo;s the fire
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To burn out what remains of the soft inside wood, so as to leave only the
      hard outside shell. Then the charring of the inner surface is supposed to
      make the leach better&mdash;more water-tight, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. Then it is hauled in and set up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and gradually filled with ashes. When it is full, we pour the water
      in it, and catch the lye as it drips out. This is put in the caldron with
      grease, pigskins, and that sort of thing, and when it boils long enough,
      the result is soft soap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you boil it too long, what is the result?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard soap, I suppose. I never boil it too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was here interrupted by a hissing in the fire, caused by
      the tumultuous boiling over of the soap. Kitty hurriedly threw in a basin
      of cold lye, and stirred the mixture vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said reproachfully, &ldquo;the result of keeping me talking
      nonsense to you. Now you will have to make up for it by bringing in some
      wood and putting more water into the leach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the utmost pleasure,&rdquo; cried Yates, springing to his feet. &ldquo;It is a
      delight to atone for a fault by obeying your commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed. &ldquo;Buttonwood,&rdquo; she said. Before Yates could think of
      anything to say in reply Mrs. Bartlett appeared at the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the soap getting on, Kitty?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why, Mr. Yates, are you
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I here? I should say I was. Very much here. I&rsquo;m the hired man. I&rsquo;m the
      hewer of wood and the hauler of water, or, to speak more correctly, I&rsquo;m
      the hauler of both. And, besides, I&rsquo;ve been learning how to make soap,
      Mrs. Bartlett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t hurt you to know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it won&rsquo;t. When I get back to New York, the first thing I shall do
      will be to chop down a buttonwood tree in the park, if I can find one, and
      set up a leach for myself. Lye comes useful in running a paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bartlett&rsquo;s eyes twinkled, for, although she did not quite understand
      his nonsense, she knew it was nonsense, and she had a liking for frivolous
      persons, her own husband being so somber-minded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea is ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course you will stay, Mr. Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Bartlett, I cannot conscientiously do so. I haven&rsquo;t earned a
      meal since the last one. No; my conscience won&rsquo;t let me accept, but thank
      you all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense; my conscience won&rsquo;t let you go away hungry. If nobody were to
      eat but those who earn their victuals, there would be more starving people
      in the world than there are. Of course you&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s what I like, Mrs. Bartlett. I like to have a chance of
      refusing an invitation I yearn for, and then be forced to accept. That&rsquo;s
      true hospitality.&rdquo; Then in a whisper he added to Kitty; &ldquo;If you dare to
      say &lsquo;buttonwood,&rsquo; Miss Bartlett, you and I will quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty said nothing, now that her mother had appeared on the scene, but
      industriously stirred the contents of the iron kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;you call the men to supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave this,&rdquo; said Kitty, flushing; &ldquo;it will boil over. You call,
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Bartlett held her open palms on each side of her mouth, and gave
      the long wailing cry, which was faintly answered from the fields, and
      Yates, who knew a thing or two, noted with secret satisfaction that Kitty
      had refused doubtless because he was there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is, Renny,&rdquo; said Yates, a few days after the soap
      episode, as he swung in his hammock at the camp, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning something
      new every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really?&rdquo; asked the professor in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, really. I knew it would astonish you. My chief pleasure in life,
      professor, is the surprising of you. I sometimes wonder why it delights
      me; it is so easily done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that. What have you been learning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisdom, my boy; wisdom in solid chunks. In the first place, I am learning
      to admire the resourcefulness of these people around us. Practically, they
      make everything they need. They are the most self-helping people that I
      was ever thrown among. I look upon theirs as the ideal life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you said something like that when we first came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that, you ass, about camping out. I am talking now about farm
      life. Farmers eliminate the middleman pretty effectually, and that in
      itself is going a long way toward complete happiness. Take the making of
      soap, that I told you about; there you have it, cheap and good. When
      you&rsquo;ve made it, you know what is in it, and I&rsquo;ll be hanged if you do when
      you pay a big price for it in New York. Here they make pretty nearly
      everything they need, except the wagon and the crockery; and I&rsquo;m not sure
      but they made them a few years back. Now, when a man with a good sharp ax
      and a jack-knife can do anything from building his house to whittling out
      a chair, he&rsquo;s the most independent man on earth. Nobody lives better than
      these people do. Everything is fresh, sweet, and good. Perhaps the country
      air helps; but it seems to me I never tasted such meals as Mrs. Bartlett,
      for instance, gets up. They buy nothing at the stores except the tea, and
      I confess I prefer milk myself. My tastes were always simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the deduction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that this is the proper way to live. Old Hiram has an anvil and an
      amateur forge. He can tinker up almost anything, and that eliminates the
      blacksmith. Howard has a bench, saws, hammers, and other tools, and that
      eliminates the carpenter. The women eliminate the baker, the soap boiler,
      and a lot of other parasites. Now, when you have eliminated all the
      middlemen, then comes independence, and consequently complete happiness.
      You can&rsquo;t keep happiness away with a shotgun then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is to become of the blacksmith, the carpenter, and all the
      rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them take up land and be happy too; there&rsquo;s plenty of land. The land
      is waiting for them. Then look how the master is eliminated. That&rsquo;s the
      most beautiful riddance of all. Even the carpenter and blacksmith usually
      have to work under a boss; and if not, they have to depend on the men who
      employ them. The farmer has to please nobody but himself. That adds to his
      independence. That&rsquo;s why old Hiram is ready to fight the first comer on
      the slightest provocation. He doesn&rsquo;t care whom he offends, so long as it
      isn&rsquo;t his wife. These people know how to make what they want, and what
      they can&rsquo;t make they do without. That&rsquo;s the way to form a great nation.
      You raise, in this way, a self-sustaining, resolute, unconquerable people.
      The reason the North conquered the South was because we drew our armies
      mostly from the self-reliant farming class, while we had to fight a people
      accustomed for generations to having things done for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you buy a farm, Yates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several reasons. I am spoiled for the life here. I am like the drunkard
      who admires a temperate life, yet can&rsquo;t pass a ginshop. The city virus is
      in my blood. And then, perhaps, after all, I am not quite satisfied with
      the tendency of farm life; it is unfortunately in a transition state. It
      is at the frame-house stage, and will soon blossom into the red-brick
      stage. The log-house era is what I yearn for. Then everything a person
      needed was made on the farm. When the brick-house era sets in, the
      middleman will be rampant. I saw the other day at the Howards&rsquo; a set of
      ancient stones that interested me as much as an Assyrian marble would
      interest you. They were old, home-made millstones, and they have not been
      used since the frame house was built. The grist mill at the village put
      them out of date. And just here, notice the subtlety of the crafty
      middleman. The farmer takes his grist to the mill, and the miller does not
      charge him cash for grinding it. He takes toll out of the bags, and the
      farmer has a vague idea that he gets his grinding for almost nothing. The
      old way was the best, Renny, my boy. The farmer&rsquo;s son won&rsquo;t be as happy in
      the brick house which the mason will build for him as his grandfather was
      in the log house he built for himself. And fools call this change the
      advance of civilization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something to be said for the old order of things,&rdquo; admitted
      Renmark. &ldquo;If a person could unite the advantages of what we call
      civilization with the advantages of a pastoral life, he would inaugurate a
      condition of things that would be truly idyllic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Renmark, that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; cried Yates enthusiastically. &ldquo;A
      brownstone mansion on Fifth Avenue, and a log hut on the shores of Lake
      Superior! That would suit me down to the ground. Spend half the year in
      each place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the professor meditatively; &ldquo;a log hut on the rocks and under
      the trees, with the lake in front, would be very nice if the hut had a
      good library attached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a daily paper. Don&rsquo;t forget the press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I draw the line there. The daily paper would mean the daily steamer
      or the daily train. The one would frighten away the fish, and the other
      would disturb the stillness with its whistle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates sighed. &ldquo;I forgot about the drawbacks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble
      with civilization. You can&rsquo;t have the things you want without bringing in
      their trail so many things you don&rsquo;t want. I shall have to give up the
      daily paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is another objection, worse than either steamer or train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daily paper itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates sat up indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Renmark!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s blasphemy. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, man, hold
      something sacred. If you don&rsquo;t respect the press, what do you respect? Not
      my most cherished feelings, at any rate, or you wouldn&rsquo;t talk in that
      flippant manner. If you speak kindly of my daily paper, I&rsquo;ll tolerate your
      library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that reminds me: Have you brought any books with you, Yates? I have
      gone through most of mine already, although many of them will bear going
      over again; still, I have so much time on my hands that I think I may
      indulge in a little general reading. When you wrote asking me to meet you
      in Buffalo, I thought you perhaps intended to tramp through the country,
      so I did not bring as many books with me as I should have done if I had
      known you were going to camp out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates sprang from the hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Books? Well, I should say so! Perhaps you think I don&rsquo;t read anything but
      the daily papers. I&rsquo;d have you know that I am something of a reader
      myself. You mustn&rsquo;t imagine you monopolize all the culture in the
      township, professor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man went into the tent, and shortly returned with an armful of
      yellow-covered, paper-bound small volumes, which he flung in profusion at
      the feet of the man from Toronto. They were mostly Beadle&rsquo;s Dime Novels,
      which had a great sale at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have quantity, quality, and variety, as I have
      before remarked. &lsquo;The Murderous Sioux of Kalamazoo;&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a good one. A
      hair-raising Indian story in every sense of the word. The one you are
      looking at is a pirate story, judging by the burning ship on the cover.
      But for first-class highwaymen yarns, this other edition is the best.
      That&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Sixteen String Jack set.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re immense, if they do cost a
      quarter each. You must begin at the right volume, or you&rsquo;ll be sorry. You
      see, they never really end, although every volume is supposed to be
      complete in itself. They leave off at the most exciting point, and are
      continued in the next volume. I call that a pretty good idea, but it&rsquo;s
      rather exasperating if you begin at the last book. You&rsquo;ll enjoy this lot.
      I&rsquo;m glad I brought them along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a blessing,&rdquo; said Renmark, with the ghost of a smile about his
      lips. &ldquo;I can truthfully say that they are entirely new to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, my boy,&rdquo; cried Yates loftily, with a wave of his hand.
      &ldquo;Use them as if they were your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark arose leisurely and picked up a quantity of the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These will do excellently for lighting our morning camp fire,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;And if you will allow me to treat them as if they were my own, that is
      the use to which I will put them. You surely do not mean to say that you
      read such trash as this, Yates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trash?&rdquo; exclaimed Yates indignantly. &ldquo;It serves me right. That&rsquo;s what a
      man gets for being decent to you, Renny. Well, you&rsquo;re not compelled to
      read them; but if you put one of them in the fire, your stupid treatises
      will follow, if they are not too solid to burn. You don&rsquo;t know good
      literature when you see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor, buoyed up, perhaps, by the conceit which comes to a man
      through the possession of a real sheepskin diploma, granted by a
      university of good standing, did not think it necessary to defend his
      literary taste. He busied himself in pruning a stick he had cut in the
      forest, and finally he got it into the semblance of a walking cane. He was
      an athletic man, and the indolence of camp life did not suit him as it did
      Yates. He tested the stick in various ways when he had trimmed it to his
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready for a ten-mile walk?&rdquo; he asked of the man in the hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, no. Man wants but little walking here below, and he
      doesn&rsquo;t want it ten miles in length either. I&rsquo;m easily satisfied. You&rsquo;re
      off, are you? Well, so long. And I say, Renny, bring back some bread when
      you return to camp. It&rsquo;s the one safe thing to do.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Renmark walked through the woods and then across the fields, until he came
      to the road. He avoided the habitations of man as much as he could, for he
      was neither so sociably inclined nor so frequently hungry as was his
      companion. He strode along the road, not caring much where it led him.
      Everyone he met gave him &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; after the friendly custom of the
      country. Those with wagons or lighter vehicles going in his direction
      usually offered him a ride, and went on, wondering that a man should
      choose to walk when it was not compulsory. The professor, like most silent
      men, found himself good company, and did not feel the need of
      companionship in his walks. He had felt relieved rather than disappointed
      when Yates refused to accompany him. And Yates, swinging drowsily in his
      hammock, was no less gratified. Even where men are firm and intimate
      friends, the first few days of camping out together is a severe strain on
      their regard for each other. If Damon and Pythias had occupied a tent
      together for a week, the worst enemy of either, or both, might at the end
      of that time have ventured into the camp in safety, and would have been
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark thought of these things as he walked along. His few days&rsquo; intimacy
      with Yates had shown him how far apart they had managed to get by
      following paths that diverged more and more widely the farther they were
      trodden. The friendship of their youth had turned out to be merely
      ephemeral. Neither would now choose the other as an intimate associate.
      Another illusion had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have surely enough self-control,&rdquo; said Renmark to himself, as he walked
      on, &ldquo;to stand his shallow flippancy for another week, and not let him see
      what I think of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates at the same time was thoroughly enjoying the peaceful silence of the
      camp. &ldquo;That man is an exaggerated schoolmaster, with all the faults of the
      species abnormally developed. If I once open out on him, he will learn
      more truth about himself in ten minutes than he ever heard in his life
      before. What an unbearable prig he has grown to be.&rdquo; Thus ran Yates&rsquo; 
      thoughts as he swung in his hammock, looking up at the ceiling of green
      leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the case was not so bad as either of them thought. If it had
      been, then were marriage not only a failure, but a practical
      impossibility. If two men can get over the first few days in camp without
      a quarrel, life becomes easier, and the tension relaxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark, as he polished off his ten miles, paid little heed to those he
      met; but one driver drew up his horse and accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How are you getting on in the tent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor was surprised at the question. Had their tenting-out
      eccentricity gone all over the country? He was not a quick man at
      recognizing people, belonging, as he did, to the
      &ldquo;I-remember-your-face-but-can&rsquo;t-recall-your-name&rdquo; fraternity. It had been
      said of him that he never, at any one time, knew the names of more than
      half a dozen students in his class; but this was an undergraduate libel on
      him. The young man who had accosted him was driving a single horse,
      attached to what he termed a &ldquo;democrat&rdquo;&mdash;a four-wheeled light wagon,
      not so slim and elegant as a buggy, nor so heavy and clumsy as a wagon.
      Renmark looked up at the driver with confused unrecognition, troubled
      because he vaguely felt that he had met him somewhere before. But his
      surprise at being addressed speedily changed into amazement as he looked
      from the driver to the load. The &ldquo;democrat&rdquo; was heaped with books. The
      larger volumes were stuck along the sides with some regularity, and in
      this way kept the miscellaneous pile from being shaken out on the road.
      His eye glittered with a new interest as it rested on the many-colored
      bindings; and he recognized in the pile the peculiar brown covers of the
      &ldquo;Bohn&rdquo; edition of classic translations, that were scattered like so many
      turnips over the top of this ridge of literature. He rubbed his eyes to
      make sure he was not dreaming. How came a farmer&rsquo;s boy to be driving a
      wagon load of books in the wilds of the country as nonchalantly as if they
      were so many bushels of potatoes?
    </p>
    <p>
      The young driver, who had stopped his horse, for the load was heavy and
      the sand was deep, saw that the stranger not only did not recognize him,
      but that from the moment he saw the books he had forgotten everything
      else. It was evidently necessary to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are coming back, will you have a ride?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I will,&rdquo; said the professor, descending to earth again
      and climbing up beside the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t remember me,&rdquo; said the latter, starting his horse again.
      &ldquo;My name is Howard. I passed you in my buggy when you were coming in with
      your tent that day on the Ridge. Your partner&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name&mdash;Yates,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;had dinner at our house the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. I recollect you now. I thought I had seen you before; but it was
      only for a moment, you know. I have a very poor memory so far as people
      are concerned. It has always been a failing of mine. Are these your books?
      And how do you happen to have such a quantity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is the library,&rdquo; said young Howard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The library?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the township library, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! The township has a library, then? I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s part of it. This is a fifth part. You know about township
      libraries, don&rsquo;t you? Your partner said you were a college man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark blushed at his own ignorance, but he was never reluctant to admit
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be ashamed to confess it, but I know nothing of township
      libraries. Please, tell me about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Howard was eager to give information to a college man, especially on
      the subject of books, which he regarded as belonging to the province of
      college-bred men. He was pleased also to discover that city people did not
      know everything. He had long had the idea that they did, and this belief
      had been annoyingly corroborated by the cocksureness of Yates. The
      professor evidently was a decent fellow, who did not pretend to universal
      knowledge. This was encouraging. He liked Renmark better than Yates, and
      was glad he had offered him a ride, although, of course, that was the
      custom; still, a person with one horse and a heavy load is exempt on a
      sandy road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he said in explanation, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like this: The township
      votes a sum of money, say a hundred dollars, or two hundred, as the case
      may be. They give notice to the Government of the amount voted, and the
      Government adds the same amount to the township money. It&rsquo;s like the old
      game: you think of a number, and they double it. The Government has a
      depository of books, in Toronto, I think, and they sell them cheaper than
      the bookstores do. At any rate, the four hundred dollars&rsquo; worth are
      bought, or whatever the amount is, and the books are the property of the
      township. Five persons are picked out in the township as librarians, and
      they have to give security. My father is librarian for this section. The
      library is divided into five parts, and each librarian gets a share. Once
      a year I go to the next section and get all their books. They go to the
      next section, again, and get all the books at that place. A man comes to
      our house to-day and takes all we have. So we get a complete change every
      year, and in five years we get back the first batch, which by that time we
      have forgotten all about. To-day is changing day all around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the books are lent to any person in each section who wishes to read
      them?&rdquo; asked the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Margaret keeps a record, and a person can have a book out for two
      weeks; after that time there is a fine, but Margaret never fines anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do people have to pay to take out the books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not likely!&rdquo; said Howard with fine contempt. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t expect people
      to pay for reading books; would you, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not. And who selected the volumes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the township can select the books if it likes, or it can send a
      committee to select them; but they didn&rsquo;t think it worth the trouble and
      expense. People grumbled enough at wasting money on books as it was, even
      if they did buy them at half price. Still, others said it was a pity not
      to get the money out of the Government when they had the chance. I don&rsquo;t
      believe any of them cared very much about the books, except father and a
      few others. So the Government chose the books. They&rsquo;ll do that if you
      leave it to them. And a queer lot of trash they sent, if you take my word
      for it. I believe they shoved off on us all the things no on else would
      buy. Even when they did pick out novels, they were just as tough as the
      history books. &lsquo;Adam Bede&rsquo; is one. They say that&rsquo;s a novel. I tried it,
      but I would rather read the history of Josephus any day. There&rsquo;s some
      fighting in that, if it is a history. Then there&rsquo;s any amount of biography
      books. They&rsquo;re no good. There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;History of Napoleon.&rsquo; Old Bartlett&rsquo;s
      got that, and he won&rsquo;t give it up. He says he was taxed for the library
      against his will. He dares them to go to law about it, and it aint worth
      while for one book. The other sections are all asking for that book; not
      that they want it, but the whole country knows that old Bartlett&rsquo;s
      a-holding on to it, so they&rsquo;d like to see some fun. Bartlett&rsquo;s read that
      book fourteen times, and it&rsquo;s all he knows. I tell Margaret she ought to
      fine him, and keep on fining, but she won&rsquo;t do it. I guess Bartlett thinks
      the book belongs to him by this time. Margaret likes Kitty and Mrs.
      Bartlett,&mdash;so does everybody,&mdash;but old Bartlett&rsquo;s a seed. There
      he sits now on his veranda, and it&rsquo;s a wonder he&rsquo;s not reading the
      &lsquo;History of Napoleon.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were passing the Bartlett house, and young Howard raised his voice
      and called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Mr. Bartlett, we want that Napoleon book. This is changing day,
      you know. Shall I come up for it, or will you bring it down? If you fetch
      it to the gate, I&rsquo;ll cart it home now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man paid no heed to what was said to him; but Mrs. Bartlett,
      attracted by the outcry, came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go along with your books, you young rascal!&rdquo; she cried, coming down
      to the gate when she saw the professor. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice way to carry bound
      books, as if they were a lot of bricks. I&rsquo;ll warrant you have lost a dozen
      between Mallory&rsquo;s and here. But easy come, easy go. It&rsquo;s plain to be seen
      they didn&rsquo;t cost you anything. I don&rsquo;t know what the world&rsquo;s a-coming to
      when the township spends its money in books, as if taxes weren&rsquo;t heavy
      enough already. Won&rsquo;t you come in, Mr. Renmark? Tea&rsquo;s on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Renmark&rsquo;s coming with me this trip, Mrs. Bartlett,&rdquo; young Howard said
      before the professor had time to reply; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll come over and take tea,
      if you&rsquo;ll invite me, as soon as I have put the horse up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go along with your nonsense,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know you.&rdquo; Then in a lower
      voice she asked: &ldquo;How is your mother, Henry&mdash;and Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty well, thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them I&rsquo;m going to run over to see them some day soon, but that need
      not keep them from coming to see me. The old man&rsquo;s going to town
      to-morrow,&rdquo; and with this hint, after again inviting the professor to a
      meal, she departed up the path to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll get down here,&rdquo; said Renmark, halfway between the two
      houses. &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you for the ride, and also for what you
      told me about the books. It was very interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried young Howard; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you do anything of
      the sort. You&rsquo;re coming home with me. You want to see the books, don&rsquo;t
      you? Very well, then, come along, Margaret is always impatient on changing
      day, she&rsquo;s so anxious to see the books, and father generally comes in
      early from the fields for the same reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the Howard homestead they noticed Margaret waiting for
      them at the gate; but when the girl saw that a stranger was in the wagon,
      she turned and walked into the house. Renmark, seeing this retreat,
      regretted he had not accepted Mrs. Bartlett&rsquo;s invitation. He was a
      sensitive man, and did not realize that others were sometimes as shy as
      himself. He felt he was intruding, and that at a sacred moment&mdash;the
      moment of the arrival of the library. He was such a lover of books, and
      valued so highly the privilege of being alone with them, that he fancied
      he saw in the abrupt departure of Margaret the same feeling of resentment
      he would himself have experienced if a visitor had encroached upon him in
      his favorite nook in the fine room that held the library of the
      university.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wagon stopped in the lane, Renmark said hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll not stay, if you don&rsquo;t mind. My friend is waiting for me at
      the camp, and will be wondering what has become of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Yates? Let him wonder. I guess he never bothers about anybody else
      as long as he is comfortable himself. That&rsquo;s how I sized him up, at any
      rate. Besides, you&rsquo;re never going back on carrying in the books, are you?
      I counted on your help. I don&rsquo;t want to do it, and it don&rsquo;t seem the
      square thing to let Margaret do it all alone; does it, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if I can be of any assistance, I shall&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can. Besides, I know my father wants to see you, anyhow.
      Don&rsquo;t you, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was coming round from the back of the house to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I what?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you wanted to see Professor Renmark when Margaret told you what
      Yates had said to her about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark reddened slightly at finding so many people had made him the
      subject of conversation, rather suspecting at the same time that the boy
      was making fun of him. Mr. Howard cordially held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is Professor Renmark, is it? I am very pleased to see you. Yes,
      as Henry was saying, I have been wanting to see you ever since my daughter
      spoke of you. I suppose Henry told you that his brother is a pupil of
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is Arthur Howard your son?&rdquo; cried Renmark, warming up at once. &ldquo;I did
      not know it. There are many young men at the college, and I have but the
      vaguest idea from what parts of the country they all come. A teacher
      should have no favorites, but I must confess to a strong liking for your
      son. He is a good boy, which cannot be said about every member of my
      class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur was always studious, so we thought we would give him a chance. I
      am glad to hear he behaves himself in the city. Farming is hard work, and
      I hope my boys will have an easier time than I had. But come in, come in.
      The missus and Margaret will be glad to see you, and hear how the boy is
      coming on with his studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went in together.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Hello, there! Wake up! Breakfa-a-a-st! I thought that would fetch
      you. Gosh! I wish I had your job at a dollar a day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates rubbed his eyes, and sat up in the hammock. At first he thought the
      forest was tumbling down about his ears, but as he collected his wits he
      saw that it was only young Bartlett who had come crashing through the
      woods on the back of one horse, while he led another by a strap attached
      to a halter. The echo of his hearty yell still resounded in the depths of
      the woods, and rang in Yates&rsquo; ears as he pulled himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you&mdash;ah&mdash;make any remarks?&rdquo; asked Yates quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy admired his gift of never showing surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, don&rsquo;t you know that it&rsquo;s not healthy to go to sleep in the middle
      of the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the middle of the day? I thought it was later. I guess I can stand
      it, if the middle of the day can. I&rsquo;ve a strong constitution. Now, what do
      you mean by dashing up on two horses into a man&rsquo;s bedroom in that reckless
      fashion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps you would like a ride. I knew you were alone, for I saw
      the professor go mooning up the road a little while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Where was he going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanged if I know, and he didn&rsquo;t look as if he knew himself. He&rsquo;s a queer
      fish, aint he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. Everybody can&rsquo;t be as sensible and handsome as we are, you know.
      Where are you going with those horses, young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get them shod. Won&rsquo;t you come along? You can ride the horse I&rsquo;m on.
      It&rsquo;s got a bridle. I&rsquo;ll ride the one with the halter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far away is the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a couple of miles or so; down at the Cross Roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s merit in the idea. I take it your generous
      offer is made in good faith, and not necessarily for publication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no concealed joke, is there? No getting me on the back of one of
      those brutes to make a public exhibition of me? Do they bite or kick or
      buck, or playfully roll over a person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried, young Bartlett indignantly. &ldquo;This is no circus. Why, a baby
      could ride this horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s about the style of horse I prefer. You see, I&rsquo;m a trifle out
      of practice. I never rode anything more spirited than a street car, and I
      haven&rsquo;t been on one of them for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can ride all right. I guess you could do most things you set your
      mind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates was flattered by this evidently sincere tribute to his capacity, so
      he got out of the hammock. The boy, who had been sitting on the horse with
      both feet on one side, now straightened his back and slipped to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I throw down the fence,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates mounted with some difficulty, and the two went trotting down the
      road. He managed to hold his place with some little uncertainty, but the
      joggling up and down worried him. He never seemed to alight in quite the
      same place on the horse&rsquo;s back, and this gave an element of chance to his
      position which embarrassed him. He expected to come down some time and
      find the horse wasn&rsquo;t there. The boy laughed at his riding, but Yates was
      too much engaged in keeping his position to mind that very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-d-dirt is s-s-said to b-b-be matter out of place, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the
      m-m-mat-matter w-w-with me.&rdquo; His conversation seemed to be shaken out of
      him by the trotting of the horse. &ldquo;I say, Bartlett, I can&rsquo;t stand this any
      longer. I&rsquo;d rather walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make him canter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck the horse over the flank with the loose end of the halter rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; shouted Yates, letting go the bridle and grasping the mane. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      make him go faster, you young fiend. I&rsquo;ll murder you when I get off&mdash;and
      that will be soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; repeated young Bartlett, and, much to his
      astonishment, Yates found it to be so. When the horse broke into a canter,
      Yates thought the motion as easy as swinging in a hammock, and as soothing
      as a rocking chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an improvement. But we&rsquo;ve got to keep it up, for if this brute
      suddenly changes to a trot, I&rsquo;m done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep it up until we come in sight of the Corners, then we&rsquo;ll slow
      down to a walk. There&rsquo;s sure to be a lot of fellows at the blacksmith&rsquo;s
      shop, so we&rsquo;ll come in on them easy like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good fellow, Bartlett,&rdquo; said Yates. &ldquo;I suspected you of tricks
      at first. I&rsquo;m afraid, if I had got another chap in such a fix, I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have let him off as easily as you have me. The temptation would have been
      too great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop at the Corners, they found four
      horses in the building ahead of them. Bartlett tied his team outside, and
      then, with his comrade, entered the wide doorway of the smithy. The shop
      was built of rough boards, and the inside was blackened with soot. It was
      not well lighted, the two windows being obscured with much smoke, so that
      they were useless as far as their original purpose was concerned; but the
      doorway, as wide as that of a barn, allowed all the light to come in that
      the smith needed for his work. At the far end and darkest corner of the
      place stood the forge, with the large bellows behind it, concealed, for
      the most part, by the chimney. The forge was perhaps six feet square and
      three or four feet high, built of plank and filled in with earth. The top
      was covered with cinders and coal, while in the center glowed the red core
      of the fire, with blue flames hovering over it. The man who worked the
      bellows chewed tobacco, and now and then projected the juice with deadly
      accuracy right into the center of the fire, where it made a momentary hiss
      and dark spot. All the frequenters of the smithy admired Sandy&rsquo;s skill in
      expectoration, and many tried in vain to emulate it. The envious said it
      was due to the peculiar formation of his front teeth, the upper row being
      prominent, and the two middle teeth set far apart, as if one were missing.
      But this was jealousy; Sandy&rsquo;s perfection in the art was due to no
      favoritism of nature, but to constant and long-continued practice.
      Occasionally with his callous right hand, never removing his left from the
      lever, Sandy pulled an iron bar out of the fire and examined it
      critically. The incandescent end of the bar radiated a blinding white
      light when it was gently withdrawn, and illuminated the man&rsquo;s head, making
      his beardless face look, against its dark background, like the smudged
      countenance of some cynical demon glowing with a fire from within. The end
      of the bar which he held must have been very hot to an ordinary mortal, as
      everyone in the shop knew, all of them, at their initiation to the country
      club, having been handed a black piece of iron from Sandy&rsquo;s hand, which he
      held unflinchingly, but which the innocent receiver usually dropped with a
      yell. This was Sandy&rsquo;s favorite joke, and made life worth living for him.
      It was perhaps not so good as the blacksmith&rsquo;s own bit of humor, but
      public opinion was divided on that point. Every great man has his own
      particular set of admirers; and there were some who said,&mdash;under
      their breaths, of course,&mdash;that Sandy could turn a horseshoe as well
      as Macdonald himself. Experts, however, while admitting Sandy&rsquo;s general
      genius, did not go so far as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half a dozen members of the club were present, and most of them
      stood leaning against something with hands deep in their trousers pockets;
      one was sitting on the blacksmith&rsquo;s bench, with his legs dangling down. On
      the bench tools were scattered around so thickly that he had had to clear
      a place before he could sit down; the taking of this liberty proved the
      man to be an old and privileged member. He sat there whittling a stick,
      aimlessly bringing it to a fine point, examining it frequently with a
      critical air, as if he were engaged in some delicate operation which
      required great discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith himself stooped with his back to one of the horses, the
      hind hoof of the animal, between his knees, resting on his leathern apron.
      The horse was restive, looking over its shoulder at him, not liking what
      was going on. Macdonald swore at it fluently, and requested it to stand
      still, holding the foot as firmly as if it were in his own iron vise,
      which was fixed to the table near the whittler. With his right hand he
      held a hot horseshoe, attached to an iron punch that had been driven into
      one of the nail holes, and this he pressed against the upraised hoof, as
      though sealing a document with a gigantic seal. Smoke and flame rose from
      the contact of the hot iron with the hoof, and the air was filled with the
      not unpleasant odor of burning horn. The smith&rsquo;s tool box, with hammer,
      pinchers, and nails, lay on the earthern floor within easy reach. The
      sweat poured from his grimy brow; for it was a hot job, and Macdonald was
      in the habit of making the most of his work. He was called the hardest
      working man in that part of the country, and he was proud of the
      designation. He was a standing reproach to the loafers who frequented his
      shop, and that fact gave him pleasure in their company. Besides, a man
      must have an audience when he is an expert in swearing. Macdonald&rsquo;s
      profanity was largely automatic,&mdash;a natural gift, as it were,&mdash;and
      he meant nothing wrong by it. In fact, when you got him fighting angry, he
      always forgot to swear; but in his calm moments oaths rolled easily and
      picturesquely from his lips, and gave fluency to his conversation.
      Macdonald enjoyed the reputation round about of being a wicked man, which
      he was not; his language was against him, that was all. This reputation
      had a misty halo thrown around it by Macdonald&rsquo;s unknown doings &ldquo;down
      East,&rdquo; from which mystical region he had come. No one knew just what
      Macdonald had done, but it was admitted on all sides that he must have had
      some terrible experiences, although he was still a young man and
      unmarried. He used to say: &ldquo;When you have come through what I have, you
      won&rsquo;t be so ready to pick a quarrel with a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This must have meant something significant, but the blacksmith never took
      anyone into his confidence; and &ldquo;down East&rdquo; is a vague place, a sort of
      indefinite, unlocalized no-man&rsquo;s-land, situated anywhere between Toronto
      and Quebec. Almost anything might have happened in such a space of
      country. Macdonald&rsquo;s favorite way of crushing an opponent was to say:
      &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve had some of my experiences, young man, you&rsquo;ll know better&rsquo;n
      to talk like that.&rdquo; All this gave a certain fascination to friendship with
      the blacksmith; and the farmers&rsquo; boys felt that they were playing with
      fire when in his company, getting, as it were, a glimpse of the dangerous
      side of life. As for work, the blacksmith reveled in it, and made it
      practically his only vice. He did everything with full steam on, and was,
      as has been said, a constant reproach to loafers all over the country.
      When there was no work to do, he made work. When there was work to do, he
      did it with a rush, sweeping the sweat from his grimy brow with his hooked
      fore finger, and flecking it to the floor with a flirt of the right hand,
      loose on the wrist, in a way that made his thumb and fore finger snap
      together like the crack of a whip. This action was always accompanied with
      a long-drawn breath, almost a sigh, that seemed to say: &ldquo;I wish I had the
      easy times you fellows have.&rdquo; In fact, since he came to the neighborhood
      the current phrase, &ldquo;He works like a steer&rdquo; had given way to, &ldquo;He works
      like Macdonald,&rdquo; except with the older people, who find it hard to change
      phrases. Yet everyone liked the blacksmith, and took no special offense at
      his untiring industry, looking at it rather as an example to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look up as the two newcomers entered, but industriously pared
      down the hoof with a curiously formed knife turned like a hook at the
      point, burned in the shoe to its place, nailed it on, and rasped the hoof
      into shape with a long, broad file. Not till he let the foot drop on the
      earthen floor, and slapped the impatient horse on the flank, did he deign
      to answer young Bartlett&rsquo;s inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, wringing the perspiration from his forehead, &ldquo;all these
      horses aint ahead of you, and you won&rsquo;t need to come next week. That&rsquo;s the
      last hoof of the last horse. No man needs to come to my shop and go away
      again, while the breath of life is left in me. And I don&rsquo;t do it, either,
      by sitting on a bench and whittling a stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Sandy, chuckling, in the admiring tone of one
      who intimated that, when the boss spoke, wisdom was uttered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one
      on you, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I can stand it, if he can,&rdquo; said the whittler from the bench;
      which was considered fair repartee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit it, you mean,&rdquo; said young Bartlett, laughing with the others at his
      own joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the blacksmith severely, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re out of shoes, and you&rsquo;ll have
      to wait till we turn some, that is, if you don&rsquo;t want the old ones reset.
      Are they good enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so, if you can find &lsquo;em; but they&rsquo;re out in the fields. Didn&rsquo;t
      think I&rsquo;d bring the horses in while they held on, did you?&rdquo; Then, suddenly
      remembering his duties, he said by, way of general introduction:
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, this is my friend Mr. Yates from New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name seemed to fall like a wet blanket on the high spirits of the
      crowd. They had imagined from the cut of his clothes that he was a
      storekeeper from some village around, or an auctioneer from a distance,
      these two occupations being the highest social position to which a man
      might attain. They were prepared to hear that he was from Welland, or
      perhaps St. Catherines; but New York! that was a crusher. Macdonald,
      however, was not a man to be put down in his own shop and before his own
      admirers. He was not going to let his prestige slip from him merely
      because a man from New York had happened along. He could not claim to know
      the city, for the stranger would quickly detect the imposture and probably
      expose him; but the slightly superior air which Yates wore irritated him,
      while it abashed the others. Even Sandy was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met some people from New York down East,&rdquo; he said in an offhand
      manner, as if, after all, a man might meet a New Yorker and still not sink
      into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Yates. &ldquo;I hope you liked them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so-so,&rdquo; replied the blacksmith airily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s good and bad among
      them, like the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you noticed that,&rdquo; said Yates. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve often thought the same
      myself. It&rsquo;s a safe remark to make; there is generally no disputing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The condescending air of the New Yorker was maddening, and Macdonald
      realized that he was losing ground. The quiet insolence of Yates&rsquo; tone was
      so exasperating to the blacksmith that he felt any language at his
      disposal inadequate to cope with it. The time for the practical joke had
      arrived. The conceit of this man must be taken down. He would try Sandy&rsquo;s
      method, and, if that failed, it would at least draw attention from himself
      to his helper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being as you&rsquo;re from New York, maybe you can decide a little bet Sandy
      here wants to have with somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sandy, quick to take the hint, picked up the bar that always lay near
      enough the fire to be uncomfortably warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you reckon that weighs?&rdquo; he said, with critical nicety
      estimating its ounces in his swaying hand. Sandy had never done it better.
      There was a look of perfect innocence on his bland, unsophisticated
      countenance, and the crowd looked on in breathless suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett was about to step forward and save his friend, but a wicked glare
      from Macdonald restrained him; besides, he felt, somehow, that his
      sympathies were with his neighbors, and not with the stranger he had
      brought among them. He thought resentfully that Yates might have been less
      high and mighty. In fact, when he asked him to come he had imagined his
      brilliancy would be instantly popular, and would reflect glory on himself.
      Now he fancied he was included in the general scorn Yates took such little
      pains to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates glanced at the piece of iron and, without taking his hands from his
      pockets, said carelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should imagine it weighed a couple of pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heft it,&rdquo; said Sandy beseechingly, holding it out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Yates, with a smile. &ldquo;Do you think I have never
      picked up a hot horseshoe before? If you are anxious to know its weight,
      why don&rsquo;t you take it over to the grocery store and have it weighed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Taint hot,&rdquo; said Sandy, as he feebly smiled and flung the iron back on
      the forge. &ldquo;If it was, I couldn&rsquo;t have held it s&rsquo;long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; returned Yates, with a grin, &ldquo;of course not. I don&rsquo;t know what a
      blacksmith&rsquo;s hands are, do I? Try something fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macdonald saw there was no triumph over him among his crowd, for they all
      evidently felt as much involved in the failure of Sandy&rsquo;s trick as he did
      himself; but he was sure that in future some man, hard pushed in argument,
      would fling the New Yorker at him. In the crisis he showed the instinct of
      a Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;fun&rsquo;s fun, but I&rsquo;ve got to work. I have to earn
      my living, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates enjoyed his victory; they wouldn&rsquo;t try &ldquo;getting at&rdquo; him again, he
      said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macdonald strode to the forge and took out the bar of white-hot iron. He
      gave a scarcely perceptible nod to Sandy, who, ever ready with tobacco
      juice, spat with great directness on the top of the anvil. Macdonald
      placed the hot iron on the spot, and quickly smote it a stalwart blow with
      the heavy hammer. The result was appalling. An instantaneous spreading fan
      of apparently molten iron lit up the place as if it were a flash of
      lightning. There was a crash like the bursting of a cannon. The shop was
      filled for a moment with a shower of brilliant sparks, that flew like
      meteors to every corner of the place. Everyone was prepared for the
      explosion except Yates. He sprang back with a cry, tripped, and, without
      having time to get the use of his hands to ease his fall, tumbled and
      rolled to the horses&rsquo; heels. The animals, frightened by the report,
      stamped around; and Yates had to hustle on his hands and knees to safer
      quarters, exhibiting more celerity than dignity. The blacksmith never
      smiled, but everyone else roared. The reputation of the country was safe.
      Sandy doubled himself up in his boisterous mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one like the old man!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Oh, lordy! lordy! He&rsquo;s all
      wool, and a yard wide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates picked himself up and dusted himself off, laughing with the rest of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I ever knew that trick before, I had forgotten it. That&rsquo;s one on me,
      as this youth in spasms said a moment ago. Blacksmith, shake! I&rsquo;ll treat
      the crowd, if there&rsquo;s a place handy.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      People who have but a superficial knowledge of the life and times here set
      down may possibly claim that the grocery store, and not the blacksmith&rsquo;s
      shop, used to be the real country club&mdash;the place where the politics
      of the country were discussed; where the doings of great men were
      commended or condemned, and the government criticised. It is true that the
      grocery store was the club of the village, when a place like the Corners
      grew to be a village; but the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop was usually the first
      building erected on the spot where a village was ultimately to stand. It
      was the nucleus. As a place grew, and enervating luxury set in, the
      grocery store slowly supplanted the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, because people
      found a nail keg, or a box of crackers, more comfortable to sit on than
      the limited seats at their disposal in a smithy; moreover, in winter the
      store, with its red-hot box stove, was a place of warmth and joy, but the
      reveling in such an atmosphere of comfort meant that the members of the
      club had to live close at hand, for no man would brave the storms of a
      Canadian winter night, and journey a mile or two through the snow, to
      enjoy even the pleasures of the store. So the grocery was essentially a
      village club, and not a rural club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, as civilization advanced, the blacksmith found it impossible to
      compete with the grocer. He could not offer the same inducements. The
      grocery approached more nearly than the smithy the grateful epicurism of
      the Athenaeum, the Reform, or the Carlton. It catered to the appetite of
      man, besides supplying him with the intellectual stimulus of debate. A box
      of soda crackers was generally open, and, although such biscuits were
      always dry, they were good to munch, if consumed slowly. The barrel of
      hazel nuts never had a lid on. The raisins, in their square box, with
      blue-tinted paper, setting forth the word &ldquo;Malaga&rdquo; under the colored
      picture of joyous Spanish grape pickers, stood on the shelves behind the
      counter, at an angle suited to display the contents to all comers,
      requiring an exceptionally long reach, and more than an ordinary amount of
      cheek, before they were got at; but the barrel of Muscavado brown sugar
      was where everyone could dip his hand in; while the man on the keg of
      tenpenny nails might extend his arm over into the display window, where
      the highly colored candies exhibited themselves, although the person who
      meddled often with them was frowned upon, for it was etiquette in the club
      not to purloin things which were expensive. The grocer himself drew the
      line at the candies, and a second helping usually brought forth the mild
      reproof:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I charge that, Sam; or would you rather pay for it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All these delicacies were taken in a somewhat surreptitious way, and the
      takers generally wore an absent-minded look, as if the purloining was not
      quite intentional on their part. But they were all good customers of the
      grocer, and the abstractions were doubtless looked on by him as being in
      the way of trade; just as the giving of a present with a pound of tea, or
      a watch with a suit of clothes, became in later days. Be that as it may,
      he never said anything unless his generosity was taken advantage of, which
      was rarely the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very often on winter nights there was a hilarious feast, that helped to
      lighten the shelves and burden the till. This ordinarily took the form of
      a splurge in cove oysters. Cove oysters came from Baltimore, of course, in
      round tins; they were introduced into Canada long before the square tin
      boxes that now come in winter from the same bivalvular city. Cove oysters
      were partly cooked before being tinned, so that they would, as the
      advertisements say, keep in any climate. They did not require ice around
      them, as do the square tins which now contain the raw oysters. Someone
      present would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with having a feed of cove oysters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then collected a subscription of ten cents or so from each member, and
      the whole was expended in several cans of oysters and a few pounds of
      crackers. The cooking was done in a tin basin on the top of the hot stove.
      The contents of the cans were emptied into this handy dish, milk was
      added, and broken crackers, to give thickness and consistency to the
      result. There were always plenty of plates, for the store supplied the
      crockery of the neighborhood. There were also plenty of spoons, for
      everything was to be had at the grocery. What more could the most exacting
      man need? On a particularly reckless night the feast ended with several
      tins of peaches, which needed no cooking, but only a sprinkling of sugar.
      The grocer was always an expert at cooking cove oysters and at opening
      tins of peaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general feeling among the members that, by indulging in these
      banquets, they were going the pace rather; and some of the older heads
      feebly protested against the indulgence of the times, but it was noticed
      that they never refrained from doing their share when it came to spoon
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man has but one life to live,&rdquo; the younger and more reckless would say,
      as if that excused the extravagance; for a member rarely got away without
      being fifteen cents out of pocket, especially when they had peaches as
      well as oysters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grocery at the Corners had been but recently established and as yet
      the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop had not looked upon it as a rival. Macdonald was
      monarch of all he surveyed, and his shop was the favorite gathering place
      for miles around. The smithy was also the patriotic center of the
      district, as a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop must be as long as anvils can take the
      place of cannon for saluting purposes. On the 24th of May, the queen&rsquo;s
      birthday, celebrated locally as the only day in the year, except Sundays,
      when Macdonald&rsquo;s face was clean and when he did no work, the firing of the
      anvils aroused the echoes of the locality. On that great day the grocer
      supplied the powder, which was worth three York shillings a pound&mdash;a
      York shilling being sixpence halfpenny. It took two men to carry an anvil,
      with a good deal of grunting; but Macdonald, if the crowd were big enough,
      made nothing of picking it up, hoisting it on his shoulder, and flinging
      it down on the green in front of his shop. In the iron mass there is a
      square hole, and when the anvil was placed upside down, the hole was
      uppermost. It was filled with powder, and a wooden plug, with a notch cut
      in it, was pounded in with a sledge hammer. Powder was sprinkled from the
      notch over the surface of the anvil, and then the crowd stood back and
      held its breath. It was a most exciting moment. Macdonald would come
      running out of the shop bareheaded, holding a long iron bar, the wavering,
      red-hot end of which descended on the anvil, while the blacksmith shouted
      in a terrifying voice: &ldquo;Look out, there!&rdquo; The loose powder hissed and spat
      for a moment, then bang went the cannon, and a great cloud of smoke rolled
      upward, while the rousing cheers came echoing back from the surrounding
      forests. The helper, with the powder-horn, would spring to the anvil and
      pour the black explosive into the hole, while another stood ready with
      plug and hammer. The delicious scent of burned gunpowder filled the air,
      and was inhaled by all the youngsters with satisfaction, for now they
      realized what real war was. Thus the salutes were fired, and thus the
      royal birthday was fittingly celebrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where two anvils were to be had, the cannonade was much brisker, as then a
      plug was not needed. The hole in the lower anvil was filled with powder,
      and the other anvil was placed over it. This was much quicker than
      pounding in a plug, and had quite as striking and detonating an effect.
      The upper anvil gave a heave, like Mark Twain&rsquo;s shot-laden frog, and fell
      over on its side. The smoke rolled up as usual, and the report was equally
      gratifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates learned all these things as he sat in the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, for
      they were still in the month of May, and the smoke of the echoing anvils
      had hardly yet cleared away. All present were eager to tell him of the
      glory of the day. One or two were good enough to express regret that he
      had not been there to see. After the disaster which had overturned Yates
      things had gone on very smoothly, and he had become one of the crowd, as
      it were. The fact that he was originally a Canadian told in his favor,
      although he had been contaminated by long residence in the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macdonald worked hard at the turning of horseshoes from long rods of iron.
      Usually an extended line of unfinished shoes bestrode a blackened
      scantling, like bodiless horsemen, the scantling crossing the shop
      overhead, just under the roof. These were the work of Macdonald&rsquo;s
      comparatively leisure days, and they were ready to be fitted to the hoofs
      of any horse that came to be shod, but on this occasion there had been
      such a run on his stock that it was exhausted, a depletion the smith
      seemed to regard as a reproach on himself, for he told Yates several times
      that he often had as many as three dozen shoes up aloft for a rainy day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sledge hammer work was to be done, one of those present stepped
      forward and swung the heavy sledge, keeping stroke for stroke with
      Macdonald&rsquo;s one-handed hammer, all of which required a nice ear for time.
      This assistance was supposed to be rendered by Sandy; but, as he remarked,
      he was no hog, and anyone who wished to show his skill was at liberty to
      do so. Sandy seemed to spend most of his time at the bellows, and when he
      was not echoing the sentiments of the boss, as he called him, he was
      commending the expertness of the <i>pro tem.</i> amateur, the wielder of
      the sledge. It was fun to the amateur, and it was an old thing with Sandy,
      so he never protested against this interference with his duty, believing
      in giving everyone a chance, especially when it came to swinging a heavy
      hammer. The whole scene brought back to Yates the days of his youth,
      especially when Macdonald, putting the finishing strokes to his shoe, let
      his hammer periodically tinkle with musical clangor on the anvil, ringing
      forth a tintinnabulation that chimed melodiously on the ear&mdash;a sort
      of anvil-chorus accompaniment to his mechanical skill. He was a real
      sleight-of-hand man, and the anvil was his orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates soon began to enjoy his visit to the rural club. As the members
      thawed out he found them all first-rate fellows, and, what was more, they
      were appreciative listeners. His stories were all evidently new to them,
      and nothing puts a man into a genial frame of mind so quickly as an
      attentive, sympathetic audience. Few men could tell a story better than
      Yates, but he needed the responsive touch of interested hearers. He hated
      to have to explain the points of his anecdotes, as, indeed, what
      story-teller does not? A cold and critical man like the professor froze
      the spring of narration at its source. Besides, Renmark had an
      objectionable habit of tracing the recital to its origin; it annoyed Yates
      to tell a modern yarn, and then discover that Aristophanes, or some other
      prehistoric poacher on the good things men were to say, had forestalled
      him by a thousand years or so. When a man is quick to see the point of
      your stories, and laughs heartily at them, you are apt to form a high
      opinion of his good sense, and to value his companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the horses were shod, and young Bartlett, who was delighted at the
      impression Yates had made, was preparing to go, the whole company
      protested against the New Yorker&rsquo;s departure. This was real flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your hurry, Bartlett?&rdquo; asked the whittler. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything
      this afternoon, if you do go home. It&rsquo;s a poor time this to mend a bad
      day&rsquo;s work. If you stay, he&rsquo;ll stay; won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Yates? Macdonald is
      going to set tires, and he needs us all to look on and see that he does it
      right; don&rsquo;t you, Mac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I get a lot of help from you while there&rsquo;s a stick to whittle,&rdquo;
       replied the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the protracted meeting to-night at the schoolhouse,&rdquo; put in
      another, anxious that all the attractions of the place should be brought
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said the whittler; &ldquo;I had forgotten about that. It&rsquo;s the
      first night, so we must all be there to encourage old Benderson. You&rsquo;ll be
      on hand to-night, won&rsquo;t you, Macdonald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith made no answer, but turned to Sandy and asked him savagely
      what in &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;-nation he was standing gawking there
      for. Why didn&rsquo;t he go outside and get things ready for the tire setting?
      What in thunder was he paying him for, anyhow? Wasn&rsquo;t there enough loafers
      round, without him joining the ranks?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy took this rating with equanimity, and, when the smith&rsquo;s back was
      turned, he shrugged his shoulders, took a fresh bite of tobacco from the
      plug which he drew from his hip pocket, winking at the others as he did
      so. He leisurely followed Macdonald out of the shop, saying in a whisper
      as he passed the whittler:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t rile the old man, if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The club then adjourned to the outside, all except those who sat on the
      bench. Yates asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Macdonald? Doesn&rsquo;t he like protracted meetings?
      And, by the way, what are protracted meetings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re revival meetings&mdash;religious meetings, you know, for
      converting sinners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Yates. &ldquo;But why protracted? Are they kept on for a week or
      two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I suppose that&rsquo;s why, although, to tell the truth, I never knew the
      reason for the name. Protracted meetings always stood for just the same
      thing ever since I was a boy, and we took it as meaning that one thing,
      without thinking why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t Macdonald like them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, it&rsquo;s like this: He never wants to go to a protracted
      meeting, yet he can&rsquo;t keep away. He&rsquo;s like a drunkard and the corner
      tavern. He can&rsquo;t pass it, and he knows if he goes in he will fall.
      Macdonald&rsquo;s always the first one to go up to the penitent bench. They rake
      him in every time. He has religion real bad for a couple of weeks, and
      then he backslides. He doesn&rsquo;t seem able to stand either the converting or
      the backsliding. I suppose some time they will gather him in finally, and
      he will stick and become a class leader, but he hasn&rsquo;t stuck up to date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he doesn&rsquo;t like to hear the subject spoken of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet he don&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t safe to twit him about it either. To tell the
      truth, I was pleased when I heard him swear at Sandy; then I knew it was
      all right, and Sandy can stand it. Macdonald is a bad man to tackle when
      he&rsquo;s mad. There&rsquo;s nobody in this district can handle him. I&rsquo;d sooner get a
      blow from a sledge hammer than meet Mac&rsquo;s fist when his dander is up. But
      so long as he swears it&rsquo;s all right. Say, you&rsquo;ll stay down for the
      meeting, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will. I&rsquo;ll see what young Bartlett intends to do. It isn&rsquo;t very
      far to walk, in any case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be lots of nice girls going your way to-night after the
      meeting. I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;ll jog along in that direction myself when
      it&rsquo;s over. That&rsquo;s the principal use I have for the meetings, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whittler and Yates got down from the bench, and joined the crowd
      outside. Young Bartlett sat on one of the horses, loath to leave while the
      tire setting was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming, Yates?&rdquo; he shouted, as his comrade appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll stay for the meeting,&rdquo; said Yates, approaching him and
      patting the horse. He had no desire for mounting and riding away in the
      presence of that critical assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said young Bartlett. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll be down at the meeting,
      too; then I can show you the way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Yates; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Bartlett galloped away, and was soon lost to sight in a cloud of
      dust. The others had also departed with their shod horses; but there were
      several new arrivals, and the company was augmented rather than
      diminished. They sat around on the fence, or on the logs dumped down by
      the wayside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few smoked, but many chewed tobacco. It was a convenient way of using the
      weed, and required no matches, besides being safer for men who had to
      frequent inflammable barns.
    </p>
    <p>
      A circular fire burned in front of the shop, oak bark being the main fuel
      used. Iron wagon tires lay hidden in this burning circle. Macdonald and
      Sandy bustled about making preparations, their faces, more hideous in the
      bright sunlight than in the comparative obscurity of the shop, giving them
      the appearance of two evil spirits about to attend some incantation scene
      of which the circular fire was the visible indication. Crosstrees, of four
      pieces of squared timber, lay near the fire, with a tireless wheel placed
      flat upon them, the hub in the square hole at the center. Shiftless
      farmers always resisted having tires set until they would no longer stay
      on the wheel. The inevitable day was postponed, time and again, by a
      soaking of the wheels overnight in some convenient puddle of water; but as
      the warmer and dryer weather approached this device, supplemented by
      wooden wedges, no longer sufficed, and the tires had to be set for summer
      work. Frequently the tire rolled off on the sandy highway, and the farmer
      was reluctantly compelled to borrow a rail from the nearest fence, and
      place it so as to support the axle; he then put the denuded wheel and its
      tire on the wagon, and drove slowly to the nearest blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, his
      vehicle &ldquo;trailing like a wounded duck,&rdquo; the rail leaving a snake&rsquo;s track
      behind it on the dusty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith had previously cut and welded the tire, reducing its
      circumference, and when it was hot enough, he and Sandy, each with a pair
      of tongs, lifted it from the red-hot circle of fire. It was pressed and
      hammered down on the blazing rim of the wheel, and instantly Sandy and
      Macdonald, with two pails of water that stood handy, poured the cold
      liquid around the red-hot zone, enveloping themselves in clouds of steam,
      the quick contraction clamping the iron on the wood until the joints
      cracked together. There could be no loitering; quick work was necessary,
      or a spoiled wheel was the result. Macdonald, alternately spluttering
      through fire and steam, was in his element. Even Sandy had to be on the
      keen jump, without a moment to call his plug of tobacco his own. Macdonald
      fussed and fussed, but got through an immense amount of work in an
      incredibly short space of time, cursing Sandy pretty much all the while;
      yet that useful man never replied in kind, contenting himself with a wink
      at the crowd when he got the chance, and saying under his breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s in great fettle to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus everybody enjoyed himself: Macdonald, because he was the center
      figure in a saturnalia of work; Sandy, because no matter how hard a man
      has to work he can chew tobacco all the time; the crowd, because the
      spectacle of fire, water, and steam was fine, and they didn&rsquo;t have to do
      anything but sit around and look on. The sun got lower and lower as, one
      by one, the spectators departed to do their chores, and prepare for the
      evening meeting. Yates at the invitation of the whittler went home with
      him, and thoroughly relished his evening meal.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret had never met any man but her father who was so fond of books as
      Professor Renmark. The young fellows of her acquaintance read scarcely
      anything but the weekly papers; they went with some care through the
      yellow almanac that was given away free, with the grocer&rsquo;s name printed on
      the back. The marvelous cures the almanac recorded were of little
      interest, and were chiefly read by the older folk, but the young men
      reveled in the jokes to be found at the bottom of every page, their only
      drawback being that one could never tell the stories at a paring-bee or
      other social gathering, because everyone in the company had read them. A
      few of the young men came sheepishly round to get a book out of the
      library, but it was evident that their interest was not so much in the
      volume as in the librarian, and when that fact became apparent to the
      girl, she resented it. Margaret was thought to be cold and proud by the
      youth of the neighborhood, or &ldquo;stuck-up,&rdquo; as they expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such a girl a man like Renmark was a revelation. He could talk of other
      things than the weather, live stock, and the prospects for the crops. The
      conversation at first did not include Margaret, but she listened to every
      word of it with interest. Her father and mother were anxious to hear about
      their boy; and from that engrossing subject the talk soon drifted to
      university life, and the differences between city and country. At last the
      farmer, with a sigh, arose to go. There is little time for pleasant talk
      on a farm while daylight lasts. Margaret, remembering her duties as
      librarian, began to take in the books from the wagon to the front room.
      Renmark, slow in most things, was quick enough to offer his assistance on
      this occasion; but he reddened somewhat as he did so, for he was unused to
      being a squire of dames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would let me do the porterage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would like to earn
      the right to look at these books sometimes, even though I may not have the
      privilege of borrowing, not being a taxable resident of the township.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The librarian,&rdquo; answered Margaret, with a smile, &ldquo;seems to be at liberty
      to use her own discretion in the matter of lending. No one has authority
      to look over her accounts, or to censure her if she lends recklessly. So,
      if you wish to borrow books, all you have to do is to ask for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure I shall avail myself of the permission. But my conscience
      will be easier if I am allowed to carry them in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be permitted to help. I like carrying them. There is no more
      delicious armful than books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Renmark looked at the lovely girl, her face radiant with enthusiasm,
      the disconcerting thought came suddenly that perhaps her statement might
      not be accurate. No such thought had ever suggested itself to him before,
      and it now filled him with guilty confusion. He met the clear, honest gaze
      of her eyes for a moment, then he stammered lamely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I too am very fond of books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they carried in the several hundred volumes, and then began to
      arrange them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no catalogue?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We never seem to need one. People come and look over the library, and
      take out whatever book they fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but still every library ought to be catalogued. Cataloguing is an
      art in itself. I have paid a good deal of attention to it, and will show
      you how it is done, if you care to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you keep a record of the volumes that are out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just write the name of the person, the title, and the date in this
      blank book. When the volume is returned, I score out the record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Renmark dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t right, is it? Is there a better way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for a small library, that ought to do; but if you were handling
      many books, I think confusion might result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell me the right way. I should like to know, even if it is a small
      library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several methods, but I am by no means sure your way is not the
      simplest, and therefore the best in this instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be put off like that,&rdquo; said Margaret, laughing. &ldquo;A
      collection of books is a collection of books, whether large or small, and
      deserves respect and the best of treatment. Now, what method is used in
      large libraries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should suggest a system of cards, though slips of paper would do.
      When any person wants to take out a book, let him make out a card, giving
      the date and the name or number of the book; he then must sign the card,
      and there you are. He cannot deny having had the book, for you have his
      own signature to prove it. The slips are arranged in a box according to
      dates, and when a book is returned, you tear up the recording paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is a very good way, and I will adopt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me send to Toronto and get you a few hundred cards. We&rsquo;ll have
      them here in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to put you to that trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no trouble at all. Now, that is settled, let us attack the
      catalogue. Have you a blank book anywhere about? We will first make an
      alphabetical list; then we will arrange them under the heads of history,
      biography, fiction, and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simple as it appeared, the making of a catalogue took a long time. Both
      were absorbed in their occupation. Cataloguing in itself is a straight and
      narrow path, but in this instance there were so many delightful side
      excursions that rapid progress could not be expected. To a reader the mere
      mention of a book brings up recollections. Margaret was reading out the
      names; Renmark, on slips of paper, each with a letter on it, was writing
      them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have you that book?&rdquo; he would say, looking up as a title was
      mentioned. &ldquo;Have you ever read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for, you see, this part of the library is all new to me. Why, here is
      one of which the leaves are not even cut. No one has read it. Is it good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the best,&rdquo; Renmark would say, taking the volume. &ldquo;Yes, I know this
      edition. Let me read you one passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret would sit in the rocking while he cut the leaves and found
      the place. One extract was sure to suggest another, and time passed before
      the title of the book found its way to the proper slip of paper. These
      excursions into literature were most interesting to both excursionists,
      but they interfered with cataloguing. Renmark read and read, ever and anon
      stopping to explain some point, or quote what someone else had said on the
      same subject, marking the place in the book, as he paused, with inserted
      fore finger. Margaret swayed back and forth in the comfortable rocking
      chair, and listened intently, her large dark eyes fixed upon him so
      earnestly that now and then, when he met them, he seemed disconcerted for
      a moment. But the girl did not notice this. At the end of one of his
      dissertations she leaned her elbow on the arm of the chair, with her cheek
      resting against her hand, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very clear you make everything, Mr. Renmark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; he said with a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my business, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a shame that girls are not allowed to go to the university;
      don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I never gave any thought to the subject, and I am not quite
      prepared to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it most unfair. The university is supported by the
      Government, is it not? Then why should half of the population be shut out
      from its advantages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t do, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many reasons,&rdquo; he replied evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they? Do you think girls could not learn, or are not as capable
      of hard study as well as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; he interrupted; &ldquo;there are plenty of girls&rsquo; schools in
      the country, you know. Some very good ones in Toronto itself, for that
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but why shouldn&rsquo;t I go to the university with my brother? There are
      plenty of boys&rsquo; schools, too, but the university is the university. I
      suppose my father helps to support it. Why, then, should one child be
      allowed to attend and the other not? It isn&rsquo;t at all just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said the professor more firmly, the more he thought
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you take that as a satisfying reason from one or your students?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The phrase, &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but, then, I&rsquo;m very exacting in class. Now, if
      you want to know, why do you not ask your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father and I have discussed the question, often, and he quite agrees with
      me in thinking it unfair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, does he?&rdquo; said Renmark, taken aback; although, when he reflected, he
      realized that the father doubtless knew as little about the dangers of the
      city as the daughter did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does your mother say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother thinks if a girl is a good housekeeper it is all that is
      required. So you will have to give me a good reason, if there is one, for
      nobody else in this house argues on your side of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Renmark in an embarrassed manner, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t know by the
      time you are twenty-five, I&rsquo;ll promise to discuss the whole subject with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret sighed as she leaned back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five?&rdquo; she cried, adding with the unconscious veracity of youth:
      &ldquo;That will be seven years to wait. Thank you, but I think I&rsquo;ll find out
      before that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will,&rdquo; Renmark answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by the sudden and unannounced entrance of her
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, you two!&rdquo; he shouted with the rude familiarity of a boy. &ldquo;It seems
      the library takes a longer time to arrange than usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret rose with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are cataloguing,&rdquo; she said severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s what you call it, is it? Can I be of any assistance, or is two
      company when they&rsquo;re cataloguing? Have you any idea what time it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must be off,&rdquo; said the professor, rising. &ldquo;My companion in
      camp won&rsquo;t know what has become of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s down at the Corners, and is going
      to stay there for the meeting to-night. Young Bartlett passed a while ago;
      he was getting the horses shod, and your friend went with him. I guess
      Yates can take care of himself, Mr. Renmark. Say, sis, will you go to the
      meeting? I&rsquo;m going. Young Bartlett&rsquo;s going, and so is Kitty. Won&rsquo;t you
      come, too, Mr. Renmark? It&rsquo;s great fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that about a religious gathering, Henry,&rdquo; said his
      sister, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what it is, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a prayer meeting?&rdquo; asked the professor, looking at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it is!&rdquo; cried Henry enthusiastically, giving no one a chance to
      speak but himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a prayer meeting, and every other kind of meeting
      all rolled into one. It&rsquo;s a revival meeting; a protracted meeting, that&rsquo;s
      what it is. You had better come with us, Mr. Renmark, and then you can see
      what it is like. You can walk home with Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This attractive <i>dénouement</i> did not seem to appeal so strongly to
      the professor as the boy expected, for he made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come, sis; won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; urged the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure Kitty is going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she is. You don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d miss it, do you? They&rsquo;ll soon be
      here, too; better go and get ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what mother says,&rdquo; replied Margaret as she left the room. She
      shortly returned, dressed ready for the meeting, and the professor
      concluded he would go also.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anyone passing the Corners that evening would have quickly seen that
      something important was on. Vehicles of all kinds lined the roadway, drawn
      in toward the fence, to the rails of which the horses were tied. Some had
      evidently come from afar, for the fame of the revivalist was widespread.
      The women, when they arrived, entered the schoolhouse, which was
      brilliantly lighted with oil lamps. The men stood around outside in
      groups, while many sat in rows on the fences, all conversing about every
      conceivable topic except religion. They apparently acted on the theory
      that there would be enough religion to satisfy the most exacting when they
      went inside. Yates sat on the top rail of the fence with the whittler,
      whose guest he had been. It was getting too dark for satisfactory
      whittling, so the man with the jack-knife improved the time by cutting
      notches in the rail on which he sat. Even when this failed, there was
      always a satisfaction in opening and shutting a knife that had a powerful
      spring at the back of it, added to which was the pleasurable danger of
      cutting his fingers. They were discussing the Fenian question, which at
      that time was occupying the minds of Canadians to some extent. Yates was
      telling them what he knew of the brotherhood in New York, and the strength
      of it, which his auditors seemed inclined to underestimate. Nobody
      believed that the Fenians would be so foolhardy as to attempt an invasion
      of Canada; but Yates held that if they did they would give the Canadians
      more trouble than was expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll turn old Bartlett on them, if they come over here. They&rsquo;ll be
      glad enough to get back if he tackles them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With his tongue,&rdquo; added another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said the whittler, &ldquo;did young Bartlett say he was coming
      to-night? I hope he&rsquo;ll bring his sister if he does. Didn&rsquo;t any of you
      fellows ask him to bring her? He&rsquo;d never think of it if he wasn&rsquo;t told. He
      has no consideration for the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you ask him? I hear you have taken to going in that direction
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Me?&rdquo; asked the whittler, quite unconcerned. &ldquo;I have no chance in
      that quarter, especially when the old man&rsquo;s around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of singing from the schoolhouse. The double doors were
      wide open, and as the light streamed out the people began to stream in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Macdonald?&rdquo; asked Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess he&rsquo;s taken to the woods. He washes his face, and then he
      hides. He has the sense to wash his face first, for he knows he will have
      to come. You&rsquo;ll see him back before they start the second hymn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys!&rdquo; said one, getting down from the fence and stretching his
      arms above his head with a yawn, &ldquo;I guess, if we&rsquo;re going in, it&rsquo;s about
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One after another they got down from the fence, the whittler shutting his
      knife with a reluctant snap, and putting it in his pocket with evident
      regret. The schoolhouse, large as it was, was filled to its utmost
      capacity&mdash;women on one side of the room, and men on the other;
      although near the door there was no such division, all the occupants of
      the back benches being men and boys. The congregation was standing,
      singing a hymn, when Yates and his comrades entered, so their quiet
      incoming was not noticed. The teacher&rsquo;s desk had been moved from the
      platform on which it usually stood, and now occupied a corner on the men&rsquo;s
      side of the house. It was used as a seat by two or three, who wished to be
      near the front, and at the same time keep an eye on the rest of the
      assemblage. The local preacher stood on the edge of the platform, beating
      time gently with his hymn book, but not singing, as he had neither voice
      nor ear for music, and happily recognized the fact. The singing was led by
      a man in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the platform, near the wall, were two chairs, on one of
      which sat the Rev. Mr. Benderson, who was to conduct the revival. He was a
      stout, powerful-looking man, but Yates could not see his face, for it was
      buried in his hands, his head being bowed in silent prayer. It was
      generally understood that he had spent a youth of fearful wickedness, and
      he always referred to himself as a brand snatched from the burning. It was
      even hinted that at one time he had been a card player, but no one knew
      this for a fact. Many of the local preachers had not the power of
      exhortation, therefore a man like the Rev. Mr. Benderson, who had that
      gift abnormally developed, was too valuable to be localized; so he spent
      the year going from place to place, sweeping, driving, coaxing, or
      frightening into the fold those stray sheep that hovered on the outskirts;
      once they were within the religious ring-fence the local minister was
      supposed to keep them there. The latter, who had given out the hymn, was a
      man of very different caliber. He was tall, pale, and thin, and his long
      black coat hung on him as if it were on a post. When the hymn was
      finished; and everyone sat down, Yates, and those with him, found seats as
      best they could at the end near the door. This was the portion of the hall
      where the scoffers assembled, but it was also the portion which yielded
      most fruit, if the revival happened to be a successful one. Yates, seeing
      the place so full, and noticing two empty benches up at the front, asked
      the whittler why they were not occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be occupied pretty soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they being kept for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you, perhaps me, perhaps both of us. You never can tell. That&rsquo;s
      the penitents&rsquo; bench.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The local preacher knelt on the platform, and offered up a prayer. He
      asked the Lord to bless the efforts of the brother who was with them there
      that night, and to crown his labors with success; through his
      instrumentality to call many wandering sinners home. There were cries of
      &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bless the Lord&rdquo; from different parts of the hall as the prayer
      was being made. On rising, another hymn was given out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Joy to the world, the Lord is come.
   Let earth receive her King.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The leader of the singing started it too low. The tune began high, and ran
      down to the bottom of the scale by the time it reached the end of the
      first line. When the congregation had got two-thirds of the way down, they
      found they could go no farther, not even those who sang bass. The leader,
      in some confusion, had to pitch the tune higher, and his miscalculation
      was looked upon as exceedingly funny by the reckless spirits at the back
      of the hall. The door opened quietly; and they all turned expecting to see
      Macdonald, but it was only Sandy. He had washed his face with but
      indifferent success, and the bulge in his cheek, like a wen, showed that
      he had not abandoned tobacco on entering the schoolhouse. He tiptoed to a
      place beside his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s outside,&rdquo; he whispered to the youth who sat nearest him,
      holding his hand to the side of his mouth so that the sound would not
      travel. Catching sight of Yates, he winked at him in a friendly sort of
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hymn gathered volume and spirit as it went on, gradually recovering
      from the misadventure at starting. When it was finished, the preacher sat
      down beside the revivalist. His part of the work was done, as there was no
      formal introduction of speaker to audience to be gone through. The other
      remained as he was with bowed head, for what appeared to be a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep silence fell on all present. Even the whisperings among the
      scoffers ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr. Benderson slowly raised his head, arose, and came to the front
      of the platform. He had a strong, masterful, clean-shaven face, with the
      heavy jaw of a stubborn man&mdash;a man not easily beaten. &ldquo;Open the
      door,&rdquo; he said in a quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last few meetings he had held he had found this an effective
      beginning. It was new to his present audience. Usually a knot of people
      stood outside, and if they were there, he made an appeal to them, through
      the open door, to enter. If no one was there, he had a lesson to impart,
      based on the silence and the darkness. In this instance it was hard to say
      which was the more surprised, the revivalist or the congregation. Sandy,
      being on his feet, stepped to the door, and threw it open. He was so
      astonished at what he saw that he slid behind the open door out of sight.
      Macdonald stood there, against the darkness beyond, in a crouching
      attitude, as if about to spring. He had evidently been trying to see what
      was going on through the keyhole; and, being taken unawares by the sudden
      opening of the door, had not had time to recover himself. No retreat was
      now possible. He stood up with haggard face, like a man who has been on a
      spree, and, without a word, walked in. Those on the bench in front of
      Yates moved together a little closer, and the blacksmith sat down on the
      vacant space left at the outside. In his confusion he drew his hand across
      his brow, and snapped his fingers loudly in the silence. A few faces at
      the back wore a grin, and would have laughed had not Sandy, closing the
      door quietly, given them one menacing look which quelled their merriment.
      He was not going to have the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; made fun of in his extremity; and
      they all had respect enough for Sandy&rsquo;s fist not to run the risk of
      encountering it after the meeting was over. Macdonald himself was more to
      be dreaded in a fight; but the chances were that for the next two or three
      weeks, if the revival were a success, there would be no danger from that
      quarter. Sandy, however, was permanently among the unconverted, and
      therefore to be feared, as being always ready to stand up for his
      employer, either with voice or blow. The unexpected incident Mr. Benderson
      had witnessed suggested no remarks at the time, so, being a wise man, he
      said nothing. The congregation wondered how he had known Macdonald was at
      the door, and none more than Macdonald himself. It seemed to many that the
      revivalist had a gift of divination denied to themselves, and this belief
      left them in a frame of mind more than ever ready to profit by the
      discourse they were about to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benderson began in a low monotone, that nevertheless penetrated to
      every part of the room. He had a voice of peculiar quality, as sweet as
      the tones of a tenor, and as pleasant to hear as music; now and then there
      was a manly ring in it which thrilled his listeners. &ldquo;A week ago
      to-night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at this very hour, I stood by the deathbed of one who
      is now among the blessed. It is four years since he found salvation, by
      the mercy of God, through the humble instrumentality of the least of his
      servants. It was my blessed privilege to see that young man&mdash;that boy
      almost&mdash;pledge his soul to Jesus. He was less than twenty when he
      gave himself to Christ, and his hopes of a long life were as strong as the
      hopes of the youngest here to-night. Yet he was struck down in the early
      flush of manhood&mdash;struck down almost without warning. When I heard of
      his brief illness, although knowing nothing of its seriousness, something
      urged me to go to him, and at once. When I reached the house, they told me
      that he had asked to see me, and that they had just sent a messenger to
      the telegraph office with a dispatch for me. I said: &lsquo;God telegraphed to
      me.&rsquo; They took me to the bedside of my young friend, whom I had last seen
      as hearty and strong as anyone here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Benderson then, in a voice quivering with emotion, told the story of
      the deathbed scene. His language was simple and touching, and it was
      evident to the most callous auditor that he spoke from the heart,
      describing in pathetic words the scene he had witnessed. His unadorned
      eloquence went straight home to every listener, and many an eye dimmed as
      he put before them a graphic picture of the serenity attending the end of
      a well-spent life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I came through among you to-night,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;as you stood
      together in groups outside this building, I caught a chance expression
      that one of you uttered. A man was speaking of some neighbor who, at this
      busy season of the year, had been unable to get help. I think the one to
      whom this man was speaking had asked if the busy man were here, and the
      answer was: &lsquo;No; he has not a minute to call his own.&rsquo; The phrase has
      haunted me since I heard it, less than an hour ago. &lsquo;Not a minute to call
      his own!&rsquo; I thought of it as I sat before you. I thought of it as I rose
      to address you. I think of it now. Who has a minute to call his own?&rdquo; The
      soft tones of the preacher&rsquo;s voice had given place to a ringing cry that
      echoed from the roof down on their heads. &ldquo;Have you? Have I? Has any king,
      any prince, any president, any ruler over men, a minute or a moment he can
      call his own? Not one. Not one of all the teeming millions on this earth.
      The minutes that are past are yours. What use have you made of them? All
      your efforts, all your prayers, will not change the deeds done in any one
      of those minutes that are past, and those only are yours. The chiseled
      stone is not more fixed than are the deeds of the minutes that are past.
      Their record is for you or against you. But where now are those minutes of
      the future&mdash;those minutes that, from this time onward, you will be
      able to call your own when they are spent? They are in the hand of God&mdash;in
      his hand to give or to withhold. And who can count them in the hand of
      God? Not you, not I, not the wisest man upon the earth. Man may number the
      miles from here to the farthest visible star; but he cannot tell you,&mdash;<i>you</i>;
      I don&rsquo;t mean your neighbor, I mean <i>you</i>,&mdash;he cannot tell YOU
      whether your minutes are to be one or a thousand. They are doled out to
      you, and you are responsible for them. But there will come a moment,&mdash;it
      may be to-night, it may be a year hence,&mdash;when the hand of God will
      close, and you will have had your sum. Then time will end for you, and
      eternity begin. Are you prepared for that awful moment&mdash;that moment
      when the last is given you, and the next withheld? What if it came now?
      Are you prepared for it? Are you ready to welcome it, as did our brother
      who died at this hour one short week ago? His was not the only deathbed I
      have attended. Some scenes have been so seared into my brain that I can
      never forget them. A year ago I was called to the bedside of a dying man,
      old in years and old in sin. Often had he been called, but he put Christ
      away from him, saying: &lsquo;At a more convenient season.&rsquo; He knew the path,
      but he walked not therein. And when at last God&rsquo;s patience ended, and this
      man was stricken down, he, foolish to the last, called for me, the
      servant, instead of to God, the Master. When I reached his side, the stamp
      of death was on his face. The biting finger of agony had drawn lines upon
      his haggard brow. A great fear was upon him, and he gripped my hand with
      the cold grasp of death itself. In that darkened room it seemed to me I
      saw the angel of peace standing by the bed, but it stood aloof, as one
      often offended. It seemed to me at the head of the bed the demon of
      eternal darkness bent over, whispering to him: &lsquo;It is too late! it is too
      late!&rsquo; The dying man looked at me&mdash;oh, such a look! May you never be
      called upon to witness its like. He gasped: &lsquo;I have lived&mdash;I have
      lived a sinful life. Is it too late?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, trembling. &lsquo;Say you
      believe.&rsquo; His lips moved, but no sound came. He died as he had lived. The
      one necessary minute was withheld. Do you hear? <i>It&mdash;was&mdash;withheld!</i>
      He had not the minute to call his own. Not that minute in which to turn
      from everlasting damnation. He&mdash;went&mdash;down&mdash;into&mdash;<i>hell</i>,
      dying as he had lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The preacher&rsquo;s voice rose until it sounded like a trumpet blast. His eyes
      shone, and his face flushed with the fervor of his theme. Then followed,
      as rapidly as words could utter, a lurid, awful picture of hell and the
      day of judgment. Sobs and groans were heard in every part of the room.
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;now&mdash;<i>now</i>!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Now is the appointed time,
      now is the day of salvation. Come now; and as you rise pray God that in
      his mercy he may spare you strength and life to reach the penitent bench.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the preacher ceased talking. Stretching out his hands, he broke
      forth, with his splendid tenor voice, into the rousing hymn, with its
      spirited marching time:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
[Musical score:  Come ye sinners, poor and needy,
  Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
  Jesus ready stands to save you.
  Full of pity, love, and power.]
</pre>
    <p>
      The whole congregation joined him. Everyone knew the words and the tune.
      It seemed a relief to the pent-up feelings to sing at the top of the
      voice. The chorus rose like a triumphal march:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
[Musical score:  Turn to the Lord, and seek salvation,
  Sound the praise of His dear name;
  Glory, honour, and salvation,
  Christ the Lord has come to reign.]
</pre>
    <p>
      As the congregation sang the preacher in stentorian tones urged sinners to
      seek the Lord while he was yet to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates felt the electric thrill in the air, and he tugged at his collar, as
      if he were choking. He could not understand the strange exaltation that
      had come over him. It seemed as if he must cry aloud. All those around him
      were much moved. There were now no scoffers at the back of the room. Most
      of them seemed frightened, and sat looking one at the other. It only
      needed a beginning, and the penitent bench would be crowded. Many eyes
      were turned on Macdonald. His face was livid, and great beads of
      perspiration stood on his brow. His strong hand clutched the back of the
      seat before him, and the muscles stood out on the portion of his arm that
      was bare. He stared like a hypnotized man at the preacher. His teeth were
      set, and he breathed hard, as would a man engaged in a struggle. At last
      the hand of the preacher seemed to be pointed directly at him. He rose
      tremblingly to his feet and staggered down the aisle, flinging himself on
      his knees, with his head on his arms, beside the penitent bench, groaning
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless the Lord!&rdquo; cried the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the starting of the avalanche. Up the aisle, with pale faces, many
      with tears streaming from their eyes, walked the young men and the old.
      Mothers, with joy in their hearts and a prayer on their lips, saw their
      sons fall prostrate before the penitent bench. Soon the contrite had to
      kneel wherever they could. The ringing salvation march filled the air,
      mingled with cries of joy and devout ejaculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; cried Yates, tearing off his collar, &ldquo;what is the matter with me? I
      never felt like this before. I must get into the open air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made for the door, and escaped unnoticed in the excitement of the
      moment. He stood for a time by the fence outside, breathing deeply of the
      cool, sweet air. The sound of the hymn came faintly to him. He clutched
      the fence, fearing he was about to faint. Partially recovering himself at
      last, he ran with all his might up the road, while there rang in his ears
      the marching words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
[Musical score:  Turn to the Lord, and seek salvation,
  Sound the praise of His dear Name.
  Glory, honour and salvation,
  Christ the Lord has come to reign.]

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When people are thrown together, especially when they are young, the
      mutual relationship existing between them rarely remains stationary. It
      drifts toward like or dislike; and cases have been known where it
      progressed into love or hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stillson Renmark and Margaret Howard became at least very firm friends.
      Each of them would have been ready to admit this much. These two had a
      good foundation on which to build up an acquaintance in the fact that
      Margaret&rsquo;s brother was a student in the university of which the professor
      was a worthy member. They had also a subject of difference, which, if it
      leads not to heated argument, but is soberly discussed, lends itself even
      more to the building of friendship than subjects of agreement. Margaret
      held, as has been indicated in a previous chapter, that the university was
      wrong in closing its doors to women. Renmark, up to the time of their
      first conversation on the subject, had given the matter but little
      thought; yet he developed an opinion contrary to that of Margaret, and was
      too honest a man, or too little of a diplomatist, to conceal it. On one
      occasion Yates had been present, and he threw himself, with the energy
      that distinguished him, into the woman side of the question&mdash;cordially
      agreeing with Margaret, citing instances, and holding those who were
      against the admission of women up to ridicule, taunting them with fear of
      feminine competition. Margaret became silent as the champion of her cause
      waxed the more eloquent; but whether she liked Richard Yates the better
      for his championship who that is not versed in the ways of women can say?
      As the hope of winning her regard was the sole basis of Yates&rsquo; 
      uncompromising views on the subject, it is likely that he was successful,
      for his experiences with the sex were large and varied. Margaret was
      certainly attracted toward Renmark, whose deep scholarship even his
      excessive self-depreciation could not entirely conceal; and he, in turn,
      had naturally a schoolmaster&rsquo;s enthusiasm over a pupil who so earnestly
      desired advancement in knowledge. Had he described his feelings to Yates,
      who was an expert in many matters, he would perhaps have learned that he
      was in love; but Renmark was a reticent man, not much given either to
      introspection or to being lavish with his confidences. As to Margaret, who
      can plummet the depth of a young girl&rsquo;s regard until she herself gives
      some indication? All that one is able to record is that she was kinder to
      Yates than she had been at the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kitty Bartlett probably would not have denied that she had a sincere
      liking for the conceited young man from New York. Renmark fell into the
      error of thinking Miss Kitty a frivolous young person, whereas she was
      merely a girl who had an inexhaustible fund of high spirits, and one who
      took a most deplorable pleasure in shocking a serious man. Even Yates made
      a slight mistake regarding her on one occasion, when they were having an
      evening walk together, with that freedom from chaperonage which is the
      birthright of every American girl, whether she belongs to a farmhouse or
      to the palace of a millionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      In describing the incident afterward to Renmark, (for Yates had nothing of
      his comrade&rsquo;s reserve in these matters) he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She left a diagram of her four fingers on my cheek that felt like one of
      those raised maps of Switzerland. I have before now felt the tap of a
      lady&rsquo;s fan in admonition, but never in my life have I met a gentle reproof
      that felt so much like a censure from the paw of our friend Tom Sayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark said with some severity that he hoped Yates would not forget that
      he was, in a measure, a guest of his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all right,&rdquo; said Yates. &ldquo;If you have any spare sympathy
      to bestow, keep it for me. My neighbors are amply able, and more than
      willing, to take care of themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now as to Richard Yates himself. One would imagine that here, at
      least, a conscientious relater of events would have an easy task. Alas!
      such is far from being the fact. The case of Yates was by all odds the
      most complex and bewildering of the four. He was deeply and truly in love
      with both of the girls. Instances of this kind are not so rare as a young
      man newly engaged to an innocent girl tries to make her believe. Cases
      have been known where a chance meeting with one girl, and not with
      another, has settled who was to be a young man&rsquo;s companion during a long
      life. Yates felt that in multitude of counsel there is wisdom, and made no
      secret of his perplexity to his friend. He complained sometimes that he
      got little help toward the solution of the problem, but generally he was
      quite content to sit under the trees with Renmark and weigh the different
      advantages of each of the girls. He sometimes appealed to his friend, as a
      man with a mathematical turn of mind, possessing an education that
      extended far into conic sections and algebraic formulae, to balance up the
      lists, and give him a candid and statistical opinion as to which of the
      two he should favor with serious proposals. When these appeals for help
      were coldly received, he accused his friend of lack of sympathy with his
      dilemma, said that he was a soulless man, and that if he had a heart it
      had become incrusted with the useless <i>debris</i> of a higher education,
      and swore to confide in him no more. He would search for a friend, he
      said, who had something human about him. The search for the sympathetic
      friend, however, seemed to be unsuccessful; for Yates always returned to
      Renmark, to have, as he remarked, ice water dashed upon his duplex-burning
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely afternoon in the latter part of May, 1866, and Yates was
      swinging idly in the hammock, with his hands clasped under his head,
      gazing dreamily up at the patches of blue sky seen through the green
      branches of the trees overhead, while his industrious friend was
      unromantically peeling potatoes near the door of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The human heart, Renny,&rdquo; said the man in the hammock reflectively, &ldquo;is a
      remarkable organ, when you come to think of it. I presume, from your lack
      of interest, that you haven&rsquo;t given the subject much study, except,
      perhaps, in a physiological way. At the present moment it is to me the
      only theme worthy of a man&rsquo;s entire attention. Perhaps that is the result
      of spring, as the poet says; but, anyhow, it presents new aspects to me
      each hour. Now, I have made this important discovery: that the girl I am
      with last seems to me the most desirable. That is contrary to the
      observation of philosophers of bygone days. Absence makes the heart grow
      fonder, <i>they</i> say. I don&rsquo;t find it so. Presence is what plays the
      very deuce with me. Now, how do you account for it, Stilly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor did not attempt to account for it, but silently attended to
      the business in hand. Yates withdrew his eyes from the sky, and fixed them
      on the professor, waiting for the answer that did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Renmark,&rdquo; he drawled at last, &ldquo;I am convinced that your treatment of
      the potato is a mistake. I think potatoes should not be peeled the day
      before, and left to soak in cold water until to-morrow&rsquo;s dinner. Of course
      I admire the industry that gets work well over before its results are
      called for. Nothing is more annoying than work left untouched until the
      last moment, and then hurriedly done. Still, virtue may be carried to
      excess, and a man may be too previous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am quite willing to relinquish the work into your hands. You may
      perhaps remember that for two days I have been doing your share as well as
      my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not complaining about <i>that</i>, at all,&rdquo; said the hammock
      magnanimously. &ldquo;You are acquiring practical knowledge, Renny, that will be
      of more use to you than all the learning taught at the schools. My only
      desire is that your education should be as complete as possible, and to
      this end I am willing to subordinate my own yearning desire for scullery
      work. I should suggest that, instead of going to the trouble of entirely
      removing the covering of the potato in that laborious way, you should
      merely peel a belt around its greatest circumference. Then, rather than
      cook the potatoes in the slow and soggy manner that seems to delight you,
      you should boil them quickly, with some salt placed in the water. The
      remaining coat would then curl outward, and the resulting potato would be
      white and dry and mealy, instead of being in the condition of a wet
      sponge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beauty of a precept, Yates, is the illustrating of it. If you are not
      satisfied with my way of boiling potatoes, give me a practical object
      lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man in the hammock sighed reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course an unimaginative person like you, Renmark, cannot realize the
      cruelty of suggesting that a man as deeply in love as I am should demean
      himself by attending to the prosaic details of household affairs. I am
      doubly in love, and much more, therefore, as that old bore Euclid used to
      say, is your suggestion unkind and uncalled for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then; don&rsquo;t criticise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is a certain sweet reasonableness in your curt suggestion. A
      man who is unable, or unwilling, to work in the vineyard should not find
      fault with the pickers. And now, Renny, for the hundredth time of asking,
      add to the many obligations already conferred, and tell me, like the good
      fellow you are, what you would do if you were in my place. To which of
      those two charming, but totally unlike, girls would you give the
      preference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; said the professor quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Renny!&rdquo; cried Yates, raising his head. &ldquo;Have you cut your finger?
      I should have warned you about using too sharp a knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the professor had not cut his finger. His use of the word given above
      is not to be defended; still, as it was spoken by him, it seemed to lose
      all relationship with swearing. He said it quietly, mildly, and, in a
      certain sense, innocently. He was astonished at himself for using it, but
      there had been moments during the past few days when the ordinary
      expletives used in the learned volumes of higher mathematics did not fit
      the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before anything more could be said there was a shout from the roadway near
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Richard Yates there?&rdquo; hailed the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Who wants him?&rdquo; cried Yates, springing out of the hammock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said a young fellow on horseback. He threw himself off a tired
      horse, tied the animal to a sapling,&mdash;which, judging by the horse&rsquo;s
      condition, was an entirely unnecessary operation,&mdash;jumped over the
      rail fence, and approached through the woods. The young men saw, coming
      toward them, a tall lad in the uniform of the telegraph service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Yates. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a hunt and a half for you. Here&rsquo;s a
      telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world did you find out where I was? Nobody has my address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble. It would have saved somebody in New York a pile
      of money if you had left it. No man ought to go to the woods without
      leaving his address at a telegraph office, anyhow.&rdquo; The young man looked
      at the world from a telegraph point of view. People were good or bad
      according to the trouble they gave a telegraph messenger. Yates took the
      yellow envelope, addressed in lead pencil, but, without opening it,
      repeated his question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how on earth did you find me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t easy;&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;My horse is about done out. I&rsquo;m
      from Buffalo. They telegraphed from New York that we were to spare no
      expense; and we haven&rsquo;t. There are seven other fellows scouring the
      country on horseback with duplicates of that dispatch, and some more have
      gone along the lake shore on the American side. Say, no other messenger
      has been here before me, has he?&rdquo; asked the boy with a touch of anxiety in
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you are the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that. I&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;most all over Canada. I got on your trail
      about two hours ago, and the folks at the farmhouse down below said you
      were up here. Is there any answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates tore open the envelope. The dispatch was long, and he read it with a
      deepening frown. It was to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fenians crossing into Canada at Buffalo. You are near the spot; get there
      as quick as possible. Five of our men leave for Buffalo to-night. General
      O&rsquo;Neill is in command of Fenian army. He will give you every facility when
      you tell him who you are. When five arrive, they will report to you. Place
      one or two with Canadian troops. Get one to hold the telegraph wire, and
      send over all the stuff the wire will carry. Draw on us for cash you need;
      and don&rsquo;t spare expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Yates finished the reading of this, he broke forth into a line of
      language that astonished Renmark, and drew forth the envious admiration of
      the Buffalo telegraph boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens and earth and the lower regions! I&rsquo;m here on my vacation. I&rsquo;m not
      going to jump into work for all the papers in New York. Why couldn&rsquo;t those
      fools of Fenians stay at home? The idiots don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;re well
      off. The Fenians be hanged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s what they will be,&rdquo; said the telegraph boy. &ldquo;Any answer,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Tell &lsquo;em you couldn&rsquo;t find me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect the boy to tell a lie,&rdquo; said the professor, speaking for the
      first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind a lie!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy, &ldquo;but not that one. No, sir.
      I&rsquo;ve had too much trouble finding you. I&rsquo;m not going to pretend I&rsquo;m no
      good. I started out for to find you, and I have. But I&rsquo;ll tell any other
      lie you like, Mr. Yates, if it will oblige you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates recognized in the boy the same emulous desire to outstrip his
      fellows that had influenced himself when he was a young reporter, and he
      at once admitted the injustice of attempting to deprive him of the fruits
      of his enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that won&rsquo;t do. No; you have found me, and you&rsquo;re a young
      fellow who will be president of the telegraph company some day, or perhaps
      hold the less important office of the United States presidency. Who knows?
      Have you a telegraph blank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the boy, fishing out a bundle from the leathern wallet
      by his side. Yates took the paper, and flung himself down under the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pencil,&rdquo; said the messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A newspaper man is never without a pencil, thank you,&rdquo; replied Yates,
      taking one out of his inside pocket. &ldquo;Now, Renmark, I&rsquo;m not going to tell
      a lie on this occasion,&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the truth is better on all occasions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are. So here goes for the solid truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates, as he lay on the ground, wrote rapidly on the telegraph blank.
      Suddenly he looked up and said to the professor: &ldquo;Say, Renmark, are you a
      doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of laws,&rdquo; replied his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that will do just as well.&rdquo; And he finished his writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; he cried, holding the paper at arm&rsquo;s length:
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;L. F. SPENCER,
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Managing Editor &lsquo;Argus,&rsquo; New York:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flat on my back. Haven&rsquo;t done a hand&rsquo;s turn for a week. Am under the
      constant care, night and day, of one of the most eminent doctors in
      Canada, who even prepares my food for me. Since leaving New York trouble
      of the heart has complicated matters, and at present baffles the doctor.
      Consultations daily. It is impossible for me to move from here until
      present complications have yielded to treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simson would be a good man to take charge in my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;YATES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Yates, with a tone of satisfaction, when he had finished the
      reading. &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor frowned, but did not answer. The boy, who partly saw through
      it, but not quite, grinned, and said: &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; cried Yates, indignant at the unjust suspicion. &ldquo;It
      is a great deal more true than you have any idea of. Ask the doctor,
      there, if it isn&rsquo;t true. Now, my boy, will you give this in when you get
      back to the office? Tell &lsquo;em to rush it through to New York. I would mark
      it &lsquo;rush&rsquo; only that never does any good, and always makes the operator
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy took the paper, and put it in his wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be paid for at the other end,&rdquo; continued Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered the messenger with a certain
      condescension, as if he were giving credit on behalf of the company.
      &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll soon be better, Mr. Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates sprang to his feet with a laugh, and followed him to the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, youngster, you are up to snuff, I can see that. They&rsquo;ll perhaps
      question you when you get back. What will you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell &lsquo;em what a hard job I had to find you, and let &lsquo;em know
      nobody else could &lsquo;a&rsquo; done it, and I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re a pretty sick man. I
      won&rsquo;t tell &lsquo;em you gave me a dollar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are, sonny; <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> get along. Here&rsquo;s five dollars, all
      in one bill. If you meet any other of the messengers, take them back with
      you. There&rsquo;s no use of their wasting valuable time in this little neck of
      the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy stuffed the bill into his vest pocket as carelessly as if it
      represented cents instead of dollars, mounted his tired horse, and waved
      his hand in farewell to the newspaper man. Yates turned and walked slowly
      back to the tent. He threw himself once more into the hammock. As he
      expected, the professor was more taciturn than ever, and, although he had
      been prepared for silence, the silence irritated him. He felt ill used at
      having so unsympathetic a companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Renmark; why don&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there is. You don&rsquo;t approve of me, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it makes any difference whether I approve or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it does. A man likes to have the approval of even the humblest
      of his fellow-creatures. Say, what will you take in cash to approve of me?
      People talk of the tortures of conscience, but you are more uncomfortable
      than the most cast-iron conscience any man ever had. One&rsquo;s own conscience
      one can deal with, but a conscience in the person of another man is beyond
      one&rsquo;s control. Now, it is like this: I am here for quiet and rest. I have
      earned both, and I think I am justified in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Yates, please spare me any cheap philosophy on the question. I
      am tired of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of me, too, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, rather&mdash;if you want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates sprang out of the hammock. For the first time since the encounter
      with Bartlett on the road Renmark saw that he was thoroughly angry. The
      reporter stood with clenched fists and flashing eyes, hesitating. The
      other, his heavy brows drawn, while not in an aggressive attitude, was
      plainly ready for an attack. Yates concluded to speak, and not to strike.
      This was not because he was afraid, for he was not a coward. The reporter
      realized that he had forced the conversation, and remembered he had
      invited Renmark to accompany him. Although this recollection stayed his
      hand, it had no effect on his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that it would do you good for once to hear a
      straight, square, unbiased opinion of yourself. You have associated so
      long with pupils, to whom your word is law, that it may interest you to
      know what a man of the world thinks of you. A few years of schoolmastering
      is enough to spoil an archangel. Now, I think, of all the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was interrupted by a cry from the fence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, do you gentlemen know where a fellow named Yates lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter&rsquo;s hand dropped to his side. A look of dismay came over his
      face, and his truculent manner changed with a suddenness that forced a
      smile even to the stern lips of Renmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates backed toward the hammock like a man who had received an unexpected
      blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Renny,&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s another of those cursed telegraph
      messengers. Go, like a good fellow, and sign for the dispatch. Sign it
      &lsquo;Dr. Renmark, for R. Yates.&rsquo; That will give it a sort of official,
      medical-bulletin look. I wish I had thought of that when the other boy was
      here. Tell him I&rsquo;m lying down.&rdquo; He flung himself into the hammock, and
      Renmark, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, walked toward the boy at the fence,
      who had repeated his question in a louder voice. In a short time he
      returned with the yellow envelope, which he tossed to the man in the
      hammock. Yates seized it savagely, tore it into a score of pieces, and
      scattered the fluttering bits around him on the ground. The professor
      stood there for a few moments in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be good enough to go on with your
      remarks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was merely going to say,&rdquo; answered Yates wearily, &ldquo;that you are a
      mighty good fellow, Renny. People who camp out always have rows. That is
      our first; suppose we let it be the last. Camping out is something like
      married life, I guess, and requires some forbearance on both sides. That
      philosophy may be cheap, but I think it is accurate. I am really very much
      worried about this newspaper business. I ought, of course, to fling myself
      into the chasm like that Roman fellow; but, hang it! I&rsquo;ve been flinging
      myself into chasms for fifteen years, and what good has it done? There&rsquo;s
      always a crisis in a daily newspaper office. I want them to understand in
      the <i>Argus</i> office that I am on my vacation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will be more apt to understand from the telegram that you&rsquo;re on your
      deathbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but, you see, Renny, we New Yorkers
      live in such an atmosphere of exaggeration that if I did not put it
      strongly it wouldn&rsquo;t have any effect. You&rsquo;ve got to give a big dose to a
      man who has been taking poison all his life. They will take off ninety per
      cent. from any statement I make, anyhow; so, you see, I have to pile it up
      pretty high before the remaining ten per cent. amounts to anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was interrupted by the crackling of the dry twigs behind
      them, and Yates, who had been keeping his eye nervously on the fence,
      turned round. Young Bartlett pushed his way through the underbrush. His
      face was red; he had evidently been running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two telegrams for you, Mr. Yates,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;The fellows that brought
      &lsquo;em said they were important; so I ran out with them myself, for fear they
      wouldn&rsquo;t find you. One of them&rsquo;s from Port Colborne, the other&rsquo;s from
      Buffalo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Telegrams were rare on the farm, and young Bartlett looked on the receipt
      of one as an event in a man&rsquo;s life. He was astonished to see Yates receive
      the double event with a listlessness that he could not help thinking was
      merely assumed for effect. Yates held them in his hand, and did not tear
      them up at once out of consideration for the feelings of the young man,
      who had had a race to deliver them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s two books they wanted you to sign. They&rsquo;re tired out, and mother&rsquo;s
      giving them something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor, you sign for me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartlett lingered a moment, hoping that he would hear something of the
      contents of the important messages; but Yates did not even open the
      envelopes, although he thanked the young man heartily for bringing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuck-up cuss!&rdquo; muttered young Bartlett to himself, as he shoved the
      signed books into his pocket and pushed his way through the underbrush
      again. Yates slowly and methodically tore the envelopes and their contents
      into little pieces, and scattered them as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begins to look like autumn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with the yellow leaves strewing
      the ground.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before night three more telegraph boys found Yates, and three more
      telegrams in sections helped to carpet the floor of the forest. The
      usually high spirits of the newspaper man went down and down under the
      repeated visitations. At last he did not even swear, which, in the case of
      Yates, always indicated extreme depression. As night drew on he feebly
      remarked to the professor that he was more tired than he had ever been in
      going through an election campaign. He went to his tent bunk early, in a
      state of such utter dejection that Renmark felt sorry for him, and tried
      ineffectually to cheer him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they would all come together,&rdquo; said Yates bitterly, &ldquo;so that one
      comprehensive effort of malediction would include the lot and have it
      over, it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad; but this constant dribbling in of messengers
      would wear out the patience of a saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he sat in his shirt sleeves on the edge of his bunk Renmark said that
      things would look brighter in the morning&mdash;which was a safe remark to
      make, for the night was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates sat silently, with his head in his hands, for some moments. At last
      he said slowly: &ldquo;There is no one so obtuse as the thoroughly good man. It
      is not the messenger I am afraid of, after all. He is but the outward
      symptom of the inward trouble. What you are seeing is an example of the
      workings of conscience where you thought conscience was absent. The
      trouble with me is that I know the newspaper depends on me, and that it
      will be the first time I have failed. It is the newspaper man&rsquo;s instinct
      to be in the center of the fray. He yearns to scoop the opposition press.
      I will get a night&rsquo;s sleep if I can, and to-morrow, I know, I shall
      capitulate. I will hunt out General O&rsquo;Neill, and interview him on the
      field of slaughter. I will telegraph pages. I will refurbish my military
      vocabulary, and speak of deploying and massing and throwing out advance
      guards, and that sort of thing. I will move detachments and advance
      brigades, and invent strategy. We will have desperate fighting in the
      columns of the <i>Argus</i>, whatever there is on the fields of Canada.
      But to a man who has seen real war this <i>opéra-bouffe</i> masquerade of
      fighting&mdash;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to say anything harsh, but to me it is
      offensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up with a wan smile at his partner, sitting on the bottom of an
      upturned pail, as he said this. Then he reached for his hip pocket and
      drew out a revolver, which he handed, butt-end forward, to the professor,
      who, not knowing his friend carried such an instrument, instinctively
      shrank from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Renny, take this weapon of devastation and soak it with the
      potatoes. If another messenger comes in on me to-night, I know I shall
      riddle him if I have this handy. My better judgment tells me he is
      innocent, and I don&rsquo;t want to shed the only blood that will be spilled
      during this awful campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How long they had been asleep they did not know, as the ghost-stories have
      it, but both were suddenly awakened by a commotion outside. It was
      intensely dark inside the tent, but as the two sat up they noticed a faint
      moving blur of light, which made itself just visible through the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another of those fiendish messengers,&rdquo; whispered Yates. &ldquo;Gi&rsquo; me that
      revolver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the other below his breath. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s about a dozen men out
      there, judging by the footfalls. I heard them coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fire into the tent and be done with it,&rdquo; said a voice outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried another; &ldquo;no man shoot. It makes too much noise, and there
      must be others about. Have ye all got yer bayonets fixed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur, apparently in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Murphy and O&rsquo;Rourick, come round to this side. You three
      stay where you are. Tim, you go to that end; and, Doolin, come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fenian army, by all the gods!&rdquo; whispered Yates, groping for his
      clothes. &ldquo;Renny, give me that revolver, and I&rsquo;ll show you more fun than a
      funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. They&rsquo;re at least three to our one. We&rsquo;re in a trap here, and
      helpless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just let me jump out among &lsquo;em and begin the fireworks. Those I
      didn&rsquo;t shoot would die of fright. Imagine scouts scouring the woods with a
      lantern&mdash;with a <i>lantern</i>, Renny! Think of that! Oh, this is
      pie! Let me at &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Keep quiet! They&rsquo;ll hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim, bring the lantern round to this side.&rdquo; The blur of light moved along
      the canvas. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man with his back against the wall of the tent.
      Just touch him up with your bayonet, Murphy, and let him know we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be twenty in the tent,&rdquo; said Murphy cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what I tell you,&rdquo; answered the man in command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murphy progged his bayonet through the canvas, and sunk the deadly point
      of the instrument into the bag of potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, he sleeps sound,&rdquo; said Murphy with a tremor of fear in his voice,
      as there was no demonstration on the part of the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Yates rang out from the interior of the tent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the old Harry do you fellows think you&rsquo;re doing, anyhow? What&rsquo;s the
      matter with you? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, broken only by a nervous scuffling of feet
      and the clicking of gun-locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many are there of you in there?&rdquo; said the stern voice of the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two, if you want to know, both unarmed, and one ready to fight the lot of
      you if you are anxious for a scrimmage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out one by one,&rdquo; was the next command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come out one by one,&rdquo; said Yates, emerging in his shirt sleeves,
      &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t expect us to keep it up long, as there are only two of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor next appeared, with his coat on. The situation certainly did
      not look inviting. The lantern on the ground threw up a pallid glow on the
      severe face of the commander, as the footlights might illuminate the
      figure of a brigand in a wood on the stage. The face of the officer showed
      that he was greatly impressed with the importance and danger of his
      position. Yates glanced about him with a smile, all his recent dejection
      gone now that he was in the midst of a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is Murphy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and which is Doolin? Hello, alderman!&rdquo; he
      cried, as his eyes rested on one tall, strapping, red-haired man who held
      his bayonet ready to charge, with a fierce determination in his face that
      might have made an opponent quail. &ldquo;When did you leave New York? and who&rsquo;s
      running the city now that you&rsquo;re gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men had evidently a sense of humor, in spite of their bloodthirsty
      business, for a smile flickered on their faces in the lantern light, and
      several bayonets were unconsciously lowered. But the hard face of the
      commander did not relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doing yourself no good by your talk,&rdquo; he said solemnly. &ldquo;What you
      say will be used against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and what you do will be used against <i>you</i>; and don&rsquo;t forget
      that fact. It&rsquo;s you who are in danger&mdash;not I. You are, at this
      moment, making about the biggest ass of yourself there is in Canada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pinion these men!&rdquo; cried the captain gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pinion nothing!&rdquo; shouted Yates, shaking off the grasp of a man who had
      sprung to his side. But both Yates and Renmark were speedily overpowered;
      and then an unseen difficulty presented itself. Murphy pathetically
      remarked that they had no rope. The captain was a man of resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut enough rope from the tent to tie them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you&rsquo;re at it, Murphy,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;cut off enough more to hang
      yourself with. You&rsquo;ll need it before long. And remember that any damage
      you do to that tent you&rsquo;ll have to pay for. It&rsquo;s hired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates gave them all the trouble he could while they tied his elbows and
      wrists together, offering sardonic suggestions and cursing their
      clumsiness. Renmark submitted quietly. When the operation was finished,
      the professor said with the calm confidence of one who has an empire
      behind him and knows it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warn you, sir, that this outrage is committed on British soil; and that
      I, on whom it is committed, am a British subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens and earth, Renmark, if you find it impossible to keep your mouth
      shut, do not use the word &lsquo;subject&rsquo; but &lsquo;citizen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied with the word, and with the protection given to those who
      use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Renmark; you had better let me do the talking. You will only
      put your foot in it. I know the kind of men I have to deal with; you
      evidently don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In tying the professor they came upon the pistol in his coat pocket.
      Murphy held it up to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said you were unarmed?&rdquo; remarked the captain severely,
      taking the revolver in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was unarmed. The revolver is mine, but the professor would not let me
      use it. If he had, all of you would be running for dear life through the
      woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit that you are a British subject?&rdquo; said the captain to Renmark,
      ignoring Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t admit it, he brags of it,&rdquo; said the latter before Renmark
      could speak. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t scare him; so quit this fooling, and let us know
      how long we are to stand here trussed up like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose, captain,&rdquo; said the red-headed man, &ldquo;that we shoot these men
      where they stand, and report to the general. They are spies. They are
      armed, and they denied it. It&rsquo;s according to the rules of war, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rules of war? What do you know of the rules of war, you red-headed
      Senegambian? Rules of Hoyle! Your line is digging sewers, I imagine. Come,
      captain, undo these ropes, and make up your mind quickly. Trot us along to
      General O&rsquo;Neill just as fast as you can. The sooner you get us there the
      more time you will have for being sorry over what you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain still hesitated, and looked from one to the other of his men,
      as if to make up his mind whether they would obey him if he went to
      extremities. Yates&rsquo; quick eye noted that the two prisoners had nothing to
      hope for, even from the men who smiled. The shooting of two unarmed and
      bound men seemed to them about the correct way of beginning a great
      struggle for freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the captain at length, &ldquo;we must do it in proper form, so I
      suppose we should have a court-martial. Are you agreed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were unanimously agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; cried Yates, and there was a certain impressiveness in his
      voice in spite of his former levity; &ldquo;this farce has gone just as far as
      it is going. Go inside the tent, there, and in my coat pocket you will
      find a telegram, the first of a dozen or two received by me within the
      last twenty-four hours. Then you will see whom you propose to shoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telegram was found, and the captain read it, while Tim held the
      lantern. He looked from under his knitted brows at the newspaper man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are one of the <i>Argus</i> staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am chief of the <i>Argus</i> staff. As you see, five of my men will be
      with General O&rsquo;Neill to-morrow. The first question they will ask him will
      be: &lsquo;Where is Yates?&rsquo; The next thing that will happen will be that you
      will be hanged for your stupidity, not by Canada nor by the State of New
      York, but by your general, who will curse your memory ever after. You are
      fooling not with a subject this time, but with a citizen; and your general
      is not such an idiot as to monkey with the United States Government; and,
      what is a blamed sight worse, with the great American press. Come,
      captain, we&rsquo;ve had enough of this. Cut these cords just as quickly as you
      can, and take us to the general. We were going to see him in the morning,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this man says he is a Canadian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. My friend is <i>me</i>. If you touch him, you touch me.
      Now, hurry up, climb down from your perch. I shall have enough trouble
      now, getting the general to forgive all the blunders you have made
      to-night, without your adding insult to injury. Tell your men to untie us,
      and throw the ropes back into the tent. It will soon be daylight. Hustle,
      and let us be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Untie them,&rdquo; said the captain, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates shook himself when his arms regained their freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;run into that tent and bring out my coat. It&rsquo;s
      chilly here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim did instantly as requested, and helped Yates on with the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; said, Yates. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve evidently been porter in a hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Yates meditatively, &ldquo;that if I you look under the
      right-hand bunk, Tim, you will find a jug. It belongs to the professor,
      although he has hidden it under my bed to divert suspicion from himself.
      Just fish it out and bring it here. It is not as full as it was, but
      there&rsquo;s enough to go round, if the professor does not take more than his
      share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gallant troop smacked their lips in anticipation, and Renmark looked
      astonished to see the jar brought forth. &ldquo;You first, professor,&rdquo; said
      Yates; and Tim innocently offered him the vessel. The learned man shook
      his head. Yates laughed, and took it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s to you, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And may you all get back as safely
      to New York as I will.&rdquo; The jar passed down along the line, until Tim
      finished its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, for the camp of the Fenian army,&rdquo; cried Yates, taking
      Renmark&rsquo;s arm; and they began their march through the woods. &ldquo;Great
      Caesar! Stilly,&rdquo; he continued to his friend, &ldquo;this is rest and quiet with
      a vengeance, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Fenians, feeling that they had to put their best foot foremost in the
      presence of their prisoners, tried at first to maintain something like
      military order in marching through the woods. They soon found, however,
      that this was a difficult thing to do. Canadian forests are not as trimly
      kept as English parks. Tim walked on ahead with the lantern, but three
      times he tumbled over some obstruction, and disappeared suddenly from
      view, uttering maledictions. His final effort in this line was a triumph.
      He fell over the lantern and smashed it. When all attempts at
      reconstruction failed, the party tramped on in go-as-you-please fashion,
      and found they did better without the light than with it. In fact,
      although it was not yet four o&rsquo;clock, daybreak was already filtering
      through the trees, and the woods were perceptibly lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be getting near the camp,&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I shout, sir?&rdquo; asked Murphy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; we can&rsquo;t miss it. Keep on as you are doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were nearer the camp than they suspected. As they blundered on among
      the crackling underbrush and dry twigs the sharp report of a rifle echoed
      through the forest, and a bullet whistled above their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fat the divil are you foiring at, Mike Lynch?&rdquo; cried the alderman, who
      recognized the shooter, now rapidly falling back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; said the sentry, stopping in his flight. The
      captain strode angrily toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by firing like that? Don&rsquo;t you know enough to ask for
      the counter-sign before shooting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I forgot about it, captain, entirely. But, then, ye see, I never
      can hit anything; so it&rsquo;s little difference it makes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shot had roused the camp, and there was now wild commotion, everybody
      thinking the Canadians were upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange sight met the eye of Yates and Renmark. Both were astonished to
      see the number of men that O&rsquo;Neill had under his command. They found a
      motley crowd. Some tattered United States uniforms were among them, but
      the greater number were dressed as ordinary individuals, although a few
      had trimmings of green braid on their clothes. Sleeping out for a couple
      of nights had given the gathering the unkempt appearance of a great
      company of tramps. The officers were indistinguishable from the men at
      first, but afterward Yates noticed that they, mostly in plain clothes and
      slouch hats, had sword belts buckled around them; and one or two had
      swords that had evidently seen service in the United States cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, boys,&rdquo; cried the captain to the excited mob. &ldquo;It was only
      that fool Lynch who fired at us. There&rsquo;s nobody hurt. Where&rsquo;s the
      general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he comes,&rdquo; said half a dozen voices at once, and the crowd made way
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      General O&rsquo;Neill was dressed in ordinary citizen&rsquo;s costume, and did not
      wear even a sword belt. On his head of light hair was a black soft felt
      hat. His face was pale, and covered with freckles. He looked more like a
      clerk from a grocery store than the commander of an army. He was evidently
      somewhere between thirty-five and forty years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why are you back? Any news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain saluted, military fashion, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We took two prisoners, sir. They were encamped in a tent in the woods.
      One of them says he is an American citizen, and says he knows you, so I
      brought them in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had brought in the tent, too,&rdquo; said the general with a wan
      smile. &ldquo;It would be an improvement on sleeping in the open air. Are these
      the prisoners? I don&rsquo;t know either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain makes a mistake in saying that I claimed a personal
      acquaintance with you, general. What I said was that you would recognize,
      somewhat quicker than he did, who I was, and the desirability of treating
      me with reasonable decency. Just show the general that telegram you took
      from my coat pocket, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper was produced, and O&rsquo;Neill read it over once or twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are on the New York <i>Argus</i>, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much so, general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you have not been roughly used?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; merely tied up in a hard knot, and threatened with shooting&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. Still, you must make some allowance at a time
      like this. If you will come with me, I will write you a pass which will
      prevent any similar mistake happening in the future.&rdquo; The general led the
      way to a smoldering camp fire, where, out of a valise, he took writing
      materials and, using the valise as a desk, began to write. After he had
      written &ldquo;Headquarters of the Grand Army of the Irish Republic&rdquo; he looked
      up, and asked Yates his Christian name. Being answered, he inquired the
      name of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want nothing from you,&rdquo; interposed Renmark. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put my name on the
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Yates. &ldquo;Never mind him, general. He&rsquo;s a
      learned man who doesn&rsquo;t know when to talk and when not to. As you march up
      to our tent, general, you will see an empty jug, which will explain
      everything. Renmark&rsquo;s drunk, not to put too fine a point upon it; and he
      imagines himself a British subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Fenian general looked up at the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a Canadian?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in that case, if I let you leave camp, you must give me your word
      that, should you fall in with the enemy, you will give no information to
      them of our position, numbers, or of anything else you may have seen while
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not give my word. On the contrary, if I should fall in with the
      Canadian troops, I will tell them where you are, that you are from eight
      hundred to one thousand strong, and the worst looking set of vagabonds I
      have ever seen out of jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General O&rsquo;Neill frowned, and looked from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize that you confess to being a spy, and that it becomes my
      duty to have you taken out and shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In real war, yes. But this is mere idiotic fooling. All of you that don&rsquo;t
      escape will be either in jail or shot before twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by the gods, it won&rsquo;t help <i>you</i> any. I&rsquo;ll have you shot
      inside of ten minutes, instead of twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, general, hold on!&rdquo; cried Yates, as the angry man rose and
      confronted the two. &ldquo;I admit that he richly deserves shooting, if you were
      the fool killer, which you are not. But it won&rsquo;t do, I will be responsible
      for him. Just finish that pass for me, and I will take care of the
      professor. Shoot me if you like, but don&rsquo;t touch him. He hasn&rsquo;t any sense,
      as you can see; but I am not to blame for that, nor are you. If you take
      to shooting everybody who is an ass, general, you won&rsquo;t have any
      ammunition left with which to conquer Canada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general smiled in spite of himself, and resumed the writing of the
      pass. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, handing the paper to Yates. &ldquo;You see, we always
      like to oblige the press. I will risk your belligerent friend, and I hope
      you will exercise more control over him, if you meet the Canadians, than
      you were able to exert here. Don&rsquo;t you think, on the whole, you had better
      stay with us? We are going to march in a couple of hours, when the men
      have had a little rest.&rdquo; He added in a lower voice, so that the professor
      could not hear: &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see anything of the Canadians, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sign. No, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll stay. There will be five of our
      fellows here some time to-day, I expect, and that will be more than
      enough. I&rsquo;m really here on a vacation. Been ordered rest and quiet. I&rsquo;m
      beginning to think I have made a mistake in location.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates bade good-by to the commander, and walked with his friend out of the
      camp. They threaded their way among sleeping men and groups of stacked
      guns. On the top of one of the bayonets was hung a tall silk hat, which
      looked most incongruous in such a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;that we will make for the Ridge Road, which must
      lie somewhere in this direction. It will be easier walking than through
      the woods; and, besides, I want to stop at one of the farmhouses and get
      some breakfast. I&rsquo;m as hungry as a bear after tramping so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the professor shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stumbled along until they reached the edge of the wood; then,
      crossing some open fields, they came presently upon the road, near the
      spot where the fist fight had taken place between Yates and Bartlett. The
      comrades, now with greater comfort, walked silently along the road toward
      the west, with the reddening east behind them. The whole scene was
      strangely quiet and peaceful, and the recollection of the weird camp they
      had left in the woods seemed merely a bad dream. The morning air was
      sweet, and the birds were beginning to sing. Yates had intended to give
      the professor a piece of his mind regarding the lack of tact and common
      sense displayed by Renmark in the camp, but, somehow, the scarcely
      awakened day did not lend itself to controversy, and the serene stillness
      soothed his spirit. He began to whistle softly that popular war song,
      &ldquo;Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching,&rdquo; and then broke in with the
      question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Renny, did you notice that plug hat on the bayonet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the professor; &ldquo;and I saw five others scattered around the
      camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jingo! you were observant. I can imagine nothing quite so ridiculous as a
      man going to war in a tall silk hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor made no reply, and Yates changed his whistling to &ldquo;Rally
      round the flag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;there is little use in attempting to
      improve the morning hour by trying to show you, Renmark, what a fool you
      made of yourself in the camp? Your natural diplomacy seemed to be slightly
      off the center.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not hold diplomatic relations with thieves and vagabonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may be vagabonds; but so am I, for that matter. They may also be
      well-meaning, mistaken men; but I do not think they are thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you were talking with the so-called general, one party came in with
      several horses that had been stolen from the neighboring farmers, and
      another party started out to get some more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that isn&rsquo;t stealing, Renmark; that&rsquo;s requisitioning. You mustn&rsquo;t use
      such reckless language. I imagine the second party has been successful;
      for here are three of them all mounted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three horsemen referred to stopped their steeds at the sight of the
      two men coming round the bend of the road, and awaited their approach.
      Like so many of the others, they wore no uniform, but two of them held
      revolvers in their hands ready for action. The one who had no visible
      revolver moved his horse up the middle of the road toward the pedestrians,
      the other two taking positions on each side of the wagon way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? Where do you come from, and where are you going?&rdquo; cried the
      foremost horseman, as the two walkers came within talking distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, commodore,&rdquo; said Yates jauntily, &ldquo;and the top of the
      morning to you. We are hungry pedestrians. We have just come from the
      camp, and we are going to get something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have a more satisfactory answer than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here you have it, then,&rdquo; answered Yates, pulling out his folded
      pass, and handing it up to the horseman. The man read it carefully. &ldquo;You
      find that all right, I expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right enough to cause your immediate arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the general said we were not to be molested further. That is in his
      own handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume it is, and all the worse for you. His handwriting does not run
      quite as far as the queen&rsquo;s writ in this country yet. I arrest you in the
      name of the queen. Cover these men with your revolvers, and shoot them
      down if they make any resistance.&rdquo; So saying, the rider slipped from his
      horse, whipped out of his pocket a pair of handcuffs joined by a short,
      stout steel chain, and, leaving his horse standing, grasped Renmark&rsquo;s
      wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Canadian,&rdquo; said the professor, wrenching his wrist away. &ldquo;You
      mustn&rsquo;t put handcuffs on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in very bad company, then. I am a constable of this county; if
      you are what you say, you will not resist arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you, but you mustn&rsquo;t handcuff me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mustn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; And, with a quick movement indicative of long practice
      with resisting criminals, the constable deftly slipped on one of the
      clasps, which closed with a sharp click and stuck like a burr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark became deadly pale, and there was a dangerous glitter in his eyes.
      He drew back his clinched fist, in spite of the fact that the cocked
      revolver was edging closer and closer to him, and the constable held his
      struggling manacled hand with grim determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; cried Yates, preventing the professor from striking the
      representative of the law. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; he shouted to the man on
      horseback; &ldquo;it is all a little mistake that will be quickly put right. You
      are three armed and mounted men, and we are only two, unarmed and on foot.
      There is no need of any revolver practice. Now, Renmark, you are more of a
      rebel at the present moment than O&rsquo;Neill. He owes no allegiance, and you
      do. Have you no respect for the forms of law and order? You are an
      anarchist at heart, for all your professions. You <i>would</i> sing &lsquo;God
      save the Queen!&rsquo; in the wrong place a while ago, so now be satisfied that
      you have got her, or, rather, that she has got you. Now, constable, do you
      want to hitch the other end of that arrangement on my wrist? or have you
      another pair for my own special use?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your wrist, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; here you are.&rdquo; Yates drew back his coat sleeve, and presented
      his wrist. The dangling cuff was speedily clamped upon it. The constable
      mounted the patient horse that stood waiting for him, watching him all the
      while with intelligent eye. The two prisoners, handcuffed together, took
      the middle of the road, with a horseman on each side of them, the
      constable bringing up the rear; thus they marched on, the professor gloomy
      from the indignity put upon them, and the newspaper man as joyous as the
      now thoroughly awakened birds. The scouts concluded to go no farther
      toward the enemy, but to return to the Canadian forces with their
      prisoners. They marched down the road, all silent except Yates, who
      enlivened the morning air with the singing of &ldquo;John Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; said the constable curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I will. But look here; we shall pass shortly the house of a
      friend. We want to go and get something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get nothing to eat until I deliver you up to the officers of the
      volunteers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where, may I ask, are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may ask, but I will not answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Renmark,&rdquo; said Yates to his companion, &ldquo;the tough part of this
      episode is that we shall have to pass Bartlett&rsquo;s house, and feast merely
      on the remembrance of the good things which Mrs. Bartlett is always glad
      to bestow on the wayfarer. I call that refined cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they neared the Bartlett homestead they caught sight of Miss Kitty on
      the veranda, shading her eyes from the rising sun, and gazing earnestly at
      the approaching squad. As soon as she recognized the group she
      disappeared, with a cry, into the house. Presently there came out Mrs.
      Bartlett, followed by her son, and more slowly by the old man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all came down to the gate and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Mrs. Bartlett!&rdquo; cried Yates cheerily. &ldquo;You see, the professor has
      got his desserts at last; and I, being in bad company, share his fate,
      like the good dog Tray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable, who knew both the farmer and his wife, nodded familiarly to
      them. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re Fenian prisoners,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett&mdash;the old man, as usual, keeping his
      mouth grimly shut when his wife was present to do the talking&mdash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;re
      not Fenians. They&rsquo;ve been camping on our farm for a week or more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the constable firmly, &ldquo;but I have the best of evidence
      against them; and, if I&rsquo;m not very much mistaken, they&rsquo;ll hang for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kitty, who had been partly visible through the door, gave a cry of
      anguish at this remark, and disappeared again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just escaped being hanged by the Fenians themselves, Mrs.
      Bartlett, and I hope the same fate awaits us at the hands of the
      Canadians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! hanging?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; just escaping. Not that I object to being hanged,&mdash;I hope I
      am not so pernickety as all that,&mdash;but, Mrs. Bartlett, you will
      sympathize with me when I tell you that the torture I am suffering from at
      this moment is the remembrance of the good things to eat which I have had
      in your house. I am simply starved to death, Mrs. Bartlett, and this
      hard-hearted constable refuses to allow me to ask you for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bartlett came out through the gate to the road in a visible state of
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoliker,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of you! You may hang a man if you
      like, but you have no right to starve him. Come straight in with me,&rdquo; she
      said to the prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Stoliker severely, &ldquo;you must not interfere with the course
      of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The course of stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; cried the angry woman. &ldquo;Do you think I
      am afraid of you, Sam Stoliker? Haven&rsquo;t I chased you out of this very
      orchard when you were a boy trying to steal my apples? Yes, and boxed your
      ears, too, when I caught you, and then was fool enough to fill your
      pockets with the best apples on the place, after giving you what you
      deserved. Course of the law, indeed! I&rsquo;ll box your ears now if you say
      anything more. Get down off your horse, and have something to eat
      yourself. I dare say you need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I call a rescue,&rdquo; whispered Yates to his linked companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a stern upholder of the law to do when the interferer with justice
      is a determined and angry woman accustomed to having her own way? Stoliker
      looked helplessly at Hiram, as the supposed head of the house, but the old
      man merely shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say: &ldquo;You see how it is
      yourself. I am helpless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bartlett marched her prisoners through the gate and up to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I ask of you now,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;is that you will give Renmark and me
      seats together at the table. We cannot bear to be separated, even for an
      instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having delivered her prisoners to the custody of her daughter, at the same
      time admonishing her to get breakfast as quickly as possible, Mrs.
      Bartlett went to the gate again. The constable was still on his horse.
      Hiram had asked, by way of treating him to a noncontroversial subject, if
      this was the colt he had bought from old Brown, on the second concession,
      and Stoliker had replied that it was. Hiram was saying he thought he
      recognized the horse by his sire when Mrs. Bartlett broke in upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sam,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no sulking, you know. Slip off the horse and come
      in. How&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty well, thank you,&rdquo; said Sam sheepishly, coming down on his
      feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty Bartlett, her gayety gone and her eyes red, waited on the prisoners,
      but absolutely refused to serve Sam Stoliker, on whom she looked with the
      utmost contempt, not taking into account the fact that the poor young man
      had been merely doing his duty, and doing it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off these handcuffs, Sam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bartlett, &ldquo;until they have
      breakfast, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker produced a key and unlocked the manacles, slipping them into his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now!&rdquo; said Yates, looking at his red wrist, &ldquo;we can breathe easier;
      and I, for one, can eat more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor said nothing. The iron had not only encircled his wrist, but
      had entered his soul as well. Although Yates tried to make the early meal
      as cheerful as possible, it was rather a gloomy festival. Stoliker began
      to feel, poor man, that the paths of duty were unpopular. Old Hiram could
      always be depended upon to add somberness and taciturnity to a wedding
      feast; the professor, never the liveliest of companions, sat silent, with
      clouded brow, and vexed even the cheerful Mrs. Bartlett by having
      evidently no appetite. When the hurried meal was over, Yates, noticing
      that Miss Kitty had left the room, sprang up and walked toward the kitchen
      door. Stoliker was on his feet in an instant, and made as though to follow
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said the professor sharply, speaking for the first time. &ldquo;He
      is not going to escape. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. He has done nothing, and has no
      fear of punishment. It is always the innocent that you stupid officials
      arrest. The woods all around you are full of real Fenians, but you take
      excellent care to keep out of their way, and give your attention to
      molesting perfectly inoffensive people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you, professor!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett emphatically. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
      truth, if ever it was spoken. But are there Fenians in the woods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundreds of them. They came on us in the tent about three o&rsquo;clock this
      morning,&mdash;or at least an advance guard did,&mdash;and after talking
      of shooting us where we stood they marched us to the Fenian camp instead.
      Yates got a pass, written by the Fenian general, so that we should not be
      troubled again. That is the precious document which this man thinks is
      deadly evidence. He never asked us a question, but clapped the handcuffs
      on our wrists, while the other fools held pistols to our heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my place to ask questions,&rdquo; retorted Stoliker doggedly. &ldquo;You can
      tell all this to the colonel or the sheriff; if they let you go, I&rsquo;ll say
      nothing against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Yates had made his way into the kitchen, taking the precaution
      to shut the door after him. Kitty Bartlett looked quickly round as the
      door closed. Before she could speak the young man caught her by the plump
      shoulders&mdash;a thing which he certainly had no right to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Kitty Bartlett,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t; and if I had, it is nothing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. Don&rsquo;t deny it. For whom were you crying?
      The professor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor for you either, although I suppose you have conceit enough to
      think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Me</i> conceited? Anything but that. Come, now, Kitty, for whom were
      you crying? I must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me go, Mr. Yates,&rdquo; said Kitty, with an effort at dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick is my name, Kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mine is not Kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right. Now that you mention it, I will call you Kitty, which
      is much prettier than the abbreviation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not &lsquo;mention it.&rsquo; Please let me go. Nobody has the right to call me
      anything but Miss Bartlett; that is, <i>you</i> haven&rsquo;t, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Kitty, don&rsquo;t you think it is about time to give somebody the right?
      Why won&rsquo;t you look up at me, so that I can tell for sure whether I should
      have accused you of crying? Look up&mdash;Miss Bartlett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me go, Mr. Yates. Mother will be here in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is a wise and thoughtful woman. We&rsquo;ll risk mother. Besides, I&rsquo;m
      not in the least afraid of her, and I don&rsquo;t believe you are. I think she
      is at this moment giving poor Mr. Stoliker a piece of her mind; otherwise,
      I imagine, he would have followed me. I saw it in his eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate that man,&rdquo; said Kitty inconsequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him, because he brought me here, even if I was handcuffed. Kitty,
      why don&rsquo;t you look up at me? Are you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I be afraid of?&rdquo; asked Kitty, giving him one swift glance
      from her pretty blue eyes. &ldquo;Not of you, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Kitty, I sincerely hope not. Now, Miss Bartlett, do you know why I
      came out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For something more to eat, very likely,&rdquo; said the girl mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, that to a man in captivity is both cruel and unkind. Besides,
      I had a first-rate breakfast, thank you. No such motive drew me into the
      kitchen. But I will tell you. You shall have it from my own lips. <i>That</i>
      was the reason!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suited the action to the word, and kissed her before she knew what was
      about to happen. At least, Yates, with all his experience, thought he had
      taken her unawares. Men often make mistakes in little matters of this
      kind. Kitty pushed him with apparent indignation from her, but she did not
      strike him across the face, as she had done before, when he merely
      attempted what he had now accomplished. Perhaps this was because she had
      been taken so completely by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall call my mother,&rdquo; she threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you won&rsquo;t. Besides, she wouldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo; Then this frivolous young
      man began to sing in a low voice the flippant refrain, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the girl
      that gets a kiss, and runs and tells her mother,&rdquo; ending with the wish
      that she should live and die an old maid and never get another. Kitty
      should not have smiled, but she did; she should have rebuked his levity,
      but she didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about the great and disastrous consequences of living and dying an
      old maid that I want to speak to you. I have a plan for the prevention of
      such a catastrophe, and I would like to get your approval of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates had released the girl, partly because she had wrenched herself away
      from him, and partly because he heard a movement in the dining room, and
      expected the entrance of Stoliker or some of the others. Miss Kitty stood
      with her back to the table, her eyes fixed on a spring flower, which she
      had unconsciously taken from a vase standing on the window-ledge. She
      smoothed the petals this way and that, and seemed so interested in
      botanical investigation that Yates wondered whether she was paying
      attention to what he was saying or not. What his plan might have been can
      only be guessed; for the Fates ordained that they should be interrupted at
      this critical moment by the one person on earth who could make Yates&rsquo; 
      tongue falter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outer door to the kitchen burst open, and Margaret Howard stood on the
      threshold, her lovely face aflame with indignation, and her dark hair down
      over her shoulders, forming a picture of beauty that fairly took Yates&rsquo; 
      breath away. She did not notice him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Kitty,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;those wretches have stolen all our horses! Is your
      father here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wretches?&rdquo; asked Kitty, ignoring the question, and startled by the
      sudden advent of her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fenians. They have taken all the horses that were in the fields, and
      your horses as well. So I ran over to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they taken your own horse, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I always keep Gypsy in the stable. The thieves did not come near the
      house. Oh, Mr. Yates! I did not see you.&rdquo; And Margaret&rsquo;s hand, with the
      unconscious vanity of a woman, sought her disheveled hair, which Yates
      thought too becoming ever to be put in order again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret reddened as she realized, from Kitty&rsquo;s evident embarrassment,
      that she had impulsively broken in upon a conference of two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell your father about it,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, and before Yates
      could open the door she had done so for herself. Again she was taken aback
      to see so many sitting round the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence between the two in the kitchen, but the spell
      was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose there will be any trouble about getting back the
      horses,&rdquo; said Yates hesitatingly. &ldquo;If you lose them, the Government will
      have to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume so,&rdquo; answered Kitty coldly; then: &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Yates; I
      mustn&rsquo;t stay here any longer.&rdquo; So saying, she followed Margaret into the
      other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates drew a long breath of relief. All his old difficulties of preference
      had arisen when the outer door burst open. He felt that he had had a
      narrow escape, and began to wonder if he had really committed himself.
      Then the fear swept over him that Margaret might have noticed her friend&rsquo;s
      evident confusion, and surmised its cause. He wondered whether this would
      help him or hurt him with Margaret, if he finally made up his mind to
      favor her with his serious attentions. Still, he reflected that, after
      all, they were both country girls, and would no doubt be only too eager to
      accept a chance to live in New York. Thus his mind gradually resumed its
      normal state of self-confidence; and he argued that, whatever Margaret&rsquo;s
      suspicions were, they could not but make him more precious in her eyes. He
      knew of instances where the very danger of losing a man had turned a
      woman&rsquo;s wavering mind entirely in the man&rsquo;s favor. When he had reached
      this point, the door from the dining room opened, and Stoliker appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are waiting for you,&rdquo; said the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the room he saw the two girls standing together talking
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I was a constable for twenty-four hours,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bartlett. &ldquo;I
      would be hunting horse thieves instead of handcuffing innocent men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said the impassive Stoliker, taking the handcuffs from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you three men,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Bartlett, &ldquo;cannot take those two to
      camp, or to jail, or anywhere else, without handcuffing them, I&rsquo;ll go
      along with you myself and protect you, and see that they don&rsquo;t escape. You
      ought to be ashamed of yourself, Sam Stoliker, if you have any manhood
      about you&mdash;which I doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must do my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor rose from his chair. &ldquo;Mr. Stoliker,&rdquo; he said with
      determination, &ldquo;my friend and myself will go with you quietly. We will
      make no attempt to escape, as we have done nothing to make us fear
      investigation. But I give you fair warning that if you attempt to put a
      handcuff on my wrist again I will smash you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cry of terror from one of the girls, at the prospect of a fight, caused
      the professor to realize where he was. He turned to them and said in a
      contrite voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I forgot you were here. I sincerely beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, with blazing eyes, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t beg my pardon, but&mdash;smash him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a consciousness of what she had said overcame her, and the excited
      girl hid her blushing face on her friend&rsquo;s shoulder, while Kitty lovingly
      stroked her dark, tangled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark took a step toward them, and stopped. Yates, with his usual
      quickness, came to the rescue, and his cheery voice relieved the tension
      of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Stoliker, don&rsquo;t be an idiot. I do not object in the least to
      the handcuffs; and, if you are dying to handcuff somebody, handcuff me. It
      hasn&rsquo;t struck your luminous mind that you have not the first tittle of
      evidence against my friend, and that, even if I were the greatest criminal
      in America, the fact of his being with me is no crime. The truth is,
      Stoliker, that I wouldn&rsquo;t be in your shoes for a good many dollars. You
      talk a great deal about doing your duty, but you have exceeded it in the
      case of the professor. I hope you have no property; for the professor can,
      if he likes, make you pay sweetly for putting the handcuffs on him without
      a warrant, or even without one jot of evidence. What is the penalty for
      false arrest, Hiram?&rdquo; continued Yates, suddenly appealing to the old man.
      &ldquo;I think it is a thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hiram said gloomily that he didn&rsquo;t know. Stoliker was hit on a tender
      spot, for he owned a farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better apologize to the professor and let us get along. Good-by, all.
      Mrs. Bartlett, that breakfast was the very best I ever tasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good woman smiled and shook hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Yates; and I hope you will soon come back to have another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker slipped the handcuffs into his pocket again, and mounted his
      horse. The girls, from the veranda, watched the procession move up the
      dusty road. They were silent, and had even forgotten the exciting event of
      the stealing of the horses.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the two prisoners, with their three captors, came in sight of the
      Canadian volunteers, they beheld a scene which was much more military than
      the Fenian camp. They were promptly halted and questioned by a picket
      before coming to the main body; the sentry knew enough not to shoot until
      he had asked for the countersign. Passing the picket, they came in full
      view of the Canadian force, the men of which looked very spick and span in
      uniforms which seemed painfully new in the clear light of the fair June
      morning. The guns, topped by a bristle of bayonets which glittered as the
      rising sun shone on them, were stacked with neat precision here and there.
      The men were preparing their breakfast, and a temporary halt had been
      called for that purpose. The volunteers were scattered by the side of the
      road and in the fields. Renmark recognized the colors of the regiment from
      his own city, and noticed that there was with it a company that was
      strange to him. Although led to them a prisoner, he felt a glowing pride
      in the regiment and their trim appearance&mdash;a pride that was both
      national and civic. He instinctively held himself more erect as he
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Renmark,&rdquo; said Yates, looking at him with a smile, &ldquo;you are making a
      thoroughly British mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? I haven&rsquo;t spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I see it in your eye. You are underestimating the enemy. You
      think this pretty company is going to walk over that body of unkempt
      tramps we saw in the woods this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed, if the tramps wait to be walked over&mdash;which I very much
      doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where you make a mistake. Most of these are raw boys, who
      know all that can be learned of war on a cricket field. They will be the
      worst whipped set of young fellows before night that this part of the
      country has ever seen. Wait till they see one of their comrades fall, with
      the blood gushing out of a wound in his breast. If they don&rsquo;t turn and
      run, then I&rsquo;m a Dutchman. I&rsquo;ve seen raw recruits before. They should have
      a company of older men here who have seen service to steady them. The
      fellows we saw this morning were sleeping like logs, in the damp woods, as
      we stepped over them. They are veterans. What will be but a mere skirmish
      to them will seem to these boys the most awful tragedy that ever happened.
      Why, many of them look as if they might be university lads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; said Renmark, with a pang of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t see what your stupid government means by sending them here
      alone. They should have at least one company of regulars with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably the regulars are on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps; but they will have to put in an appearance mighty sudden, or the
      fight will be over. If these boys are not in a hurry with their meal, the
      Fenians will be upon them before they know it. If there is to be a fight,
      it will be before a very few hours&mdash;before one hour passes, you are
      going to see a miniature Bull Run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the volunteers crowded around the incomers, eagerly inquiring for
      news of the enemy. The Fenians had taken the precaution to cut all the
      telegraph wires leading out of Fort Erie, and hence those in command of
      the companies did not even know that the enemy had left that locality.
      They were now on their way to a point where they were to meet Colonel
      Peacocke&rsquo;s force of regulars&mdash;a point which they were destined never
      to reach. Stoliker sought an officer and delivered up his prisoners,
      together with the incriminating paper that Yates had handed to him. The
      officer&rsquo;s decision was short and sharp, as military decisions are
      generally supposed to be. He ordered the constable to take both the
      prisoners and put them in jail at Port Colborne. There was no time now for
      an inquiry into the case,&mdash;that could come afterward,&mdash;and, so
      long as the men were safe in jail, everything would be all right. To this
      the constable mildly interposed two objections. In the first place, he
      said, he was with the volunteers not in his capacity as constable, but in
      the position of guide and man who knew the country. In the second place,
      there was no jail at Port Colborne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the nearest jail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jail of the county is at Welland, the county town,&rdquo; replied the
      constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; take them there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am here as guide,&rdquo; repeated Stoliker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t handcuffs with you, I
      presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; said Stoliker, producing the implements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, handcuff them together, and I will send one of the company
      over to Welland with them. How far is it across country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer called one of the volunteers, and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to make your way across country to Welland, and deliver these men
      up to the jailer there. They will be handcuffed together, but you take a
      revolver with you, and if they give you any trouble, shoot them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The volunteer reddened, and drew himself up. &ldquo;I am not a policeman,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I am a soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then your first duty as a soldier is to obey orders. I order
      you to take these men to Welland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The volunteers had crowded around as this discussion went on, and a murmur
      rose among them at the order of the officer. They evidently sympathized
      with their comrade&rsquo;s objection to the duties of a policeman. One of them
      made his way through the crowd, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! this is the professor. This is Mr. Renmark. He&rsquo;s no Fenian.&rdquo; Two
      or three more of the university students recognized Renmark, and, pushing
      up to him, greeted him warmly. He was evidently a favorite with his class.
      Among others young Howard pressed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nonsense,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;talking about sending Professor Renmark to
      jail! He is no more a Fenian than Governor-General Monck. We&rsquo;ll all go
      bail for the professor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer wavered. &ldquo;If you know him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is a different
      matter. But this other man has a letter from the commander of the Fenians,
      recommending him to the consideration of all friends of the Fenian cause.
      I can&rsquo;t let him go free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the chief in command here?&rdquo; asked Renmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Yates is a friend of mine who is here with me on his vacation. He is
      a New York journalist, and has nothing in common with the invaders. If you
      insist on sending him to Welland, I must demand that we be taken before
      the officer in command. In any case, he and I stand or fall together. I am
      exactly as guilty or innocent as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t bother the colonel about every triviality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s liberty is no triviality. What, in the name of common sense, are
      you fighting for but liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Renmark, thanks,&rdquo; said Yates; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care to see the
      colonel, and I shall welcome Welland jail. I am tired of all this bother.
      I came here for rest and quiet, and I am going to have them, if I have to
      go to jail for them. I&rsquo;m coming reluctantly to the belief that jail&rsquo;s the
      most comfortable place in Canada, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is an outrage,&rdquo; cried the professor indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; replied Yates wearily; &ldquo;but the woods are full of them.
      There&rsquo;s always outrages going on, especially in so-called free countries;
      therefore one more or less won&rsquo;t make much difference. Come, officer,
      who&rsquo;s going to take me to Welland? or shall I have to go by myself? I&rsquo;m a
      Fenian from &lsquo;way back, and came here especially to overturn the throne and
      take it home with me. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, know your own mind one way or
      other, and let us end this conference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer was wroth. He speedily gave the order to Stoliker to handcuff
      the prisoner to himself, and deliver him to the jailer at Welland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want assistance,&rdquo; objected Stoliker. &ldquo;The prisoner is a bigger man
      than I am.&rdquo; The volunteers laughed as Stoliker mentioned this self-evident
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anyone likes to go with you, he can go. I shall give no orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one volunteered to accompany the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this revolver with you,&rdquo; continued the officer, &ldquo;and if he attempts
      to escape, shoot him. Besides, you know the way to Welland, so I can&rsquo;t
      send anybody in your place, even if I wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howard knows the way,&rdquo; persisted Stoliker. That young man spoke up with
      great indignation: &ldquo;Yes, but Howard isn&rsquo;t constable, and Stoliker is. I&rsquo;m
      not going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark went up to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s acting foolishly now, Yates?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you insist on
      seeing the colonel? The chances are ten to one that you would be allowed
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any mistake. The colonel will very likely be some fussy
      individual who magnifies his own importance, and who will send a squad of
      volunteers to escort me, and I want to avoid that. These officers always
      stick by each other; they&rsquo;re bound to. I want to go alone with Stoliker. I
      have a score to settle with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t do anything rash. You&rsquo;ve done nothing so far; but if you
      assault an officer of the law, that will be a different matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan reproving sin. Who prevented you from hitting Stoliker a short time
      since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was wrong then. You are wrong now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Renny,&rdquo; whispered Yates; &ldquo;you get back to the tent, and see
      that everything&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll be with you in an hour or so. Don&rsquo;t look
      so frightened. I won&rsquo;t hurt Stoliker. But I want to see this fight, and I
      won&rsquo;t get there if the colonel sends an escort. I&rsquo;m going to use Stoliker
      as a shield when the bullets begin flying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bugles sounded for the troops to fall in, and Stoliker very
      reluctantly attached one clasp of the handcuff around his own left wrist,
      while he snapped the other on the right wrist of Yates, who embarrassed
      him with kindly assistance. The two manacled men disappeared down the
      road, while the volunteers rapidly fell in to continue their morning&rsquo;s
      march.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Howard beckoned to the professor from his place in the ranks. &ldquo;I
      say, professor, how did you happen to be down this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been camping out here for a week or more with Yates, who is an old
      schoolfellow of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame to have him led off in that way! But he seemed to rather
      like the idea. Jolly fellow, I should say. How I wish I had known you were
      in this neighborhood. My folks live near here. They would only have been
      too glad to be of assistance to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been of assistance to me, and exceedingly kind as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You know them? All of them? Have you met Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the professor slowly, but his glance fell as it encountered
      the eager eyes of the youth. It was evident that Margaret was the
      brother&rsquo;s favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fall back, there!&rdquo; cried the officer to Renmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I march along with them? or can you give me a gun, and let me take
      part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the officer with some hauteur; &ldquo;this is no place for
      civilians.&rdquo; Again the professor smiled as he reflected that the whole
      company, as far as martial experience went, were merely civilians dressed
      in uniform; but he became grave again when he remembered Yates&rsquo; ominous
      prediction regarding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Mr. Renmark,&rdquo; cried young Howard, as the company moved off, &ldquo;if
      you see any of them, don&rsquo;t tell them I&rsquo;m here&mdash;especially Margaret.
      It might make them uneasy. I&rsquo;ll get leave when this is over, and drop in
      on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy spoke with the hopeful confidence of youth, and had evidently no
      premonition of how his appointment would be kept. Renmark left the road,
      and struck across country in the direction of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, two men were tramping steadily along the dusty road toward
      Welland: the captor moody and silent, the prisoner talkative and
      entertaining&mdash;indeed, Yates&rsquo; conversation often went beyond
      entertainment, and became, at times, instructive. He discussed the affairs
      of both countries, showed a way out of all political difficulties, gave
      reasons for the practical use of common sense in every emergency, passed
      opinions on the methods of agriculture adopted in various parts of the
      country, told stories of the war, gave instances of men in captivity
      murdering those who were in charge of them, deduced from these anecdotes
      the foolishness of resisting lawful authority lawfully exercised, and, in
      general, showed that he was a man who respected power and the exercise
      thereof. Suddenly branching to more practical matters, he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Stoliker, how many taverns are there between here and Welland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker had never counted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s encouraging, anyhow. If there are so many that it requires
      an effort of the memory to enumerate them, we will likely have something
      to drink before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never drink while on duty,&rdquo; said Stoliker curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, don&rsquo;t apologize for it. Every man has his failings. I&rsquo;ll be
      only too happy to give you some instructions. I have acquired the useful
      practice of being able to drink both on and off duty. Anything can be
      done, Stoliker, if you give your mind to it. I don&rsquo;t believe in the word
      &lsquo;can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; either with or without the mark of elision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker did not answer, and Yates yawned wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would hire a rig, constable. I&rsquo;m tired of walking. I&rsquo;ve been
      on my feet ever since three this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no authority to hire a buggy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you do when a prisoner refuses to move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make him move,&rdquo; said Stoliker shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see. That&rsquo;s a good plan, and saves bills at the livery stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came to a tempting bank by the roadside, when Yates cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down and have a rest. I&rsquo;m done out. The sun is hot, and the
      road dusty. You can let me have half an hour: the day&rsquo;s young, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you have fifteen minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down together. &ldquo;I wish a team would come along,&rdquo; said Yates with
      a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No chance of a team, with most of the horses in the neighborhood stolen,
      and the troops on the roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented Yates sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was evidently tired out, for his chin dropped on his breast, and his
      eyes closed. His breathing came soft and regular, and his body leaned
      toward the constable, who sat bolt upright. Yates&rsquo; left arm fell across
      the knees of Stoliker, and he leaned more and more heavily against him.
      The constable did not know whether he was shamming or not, but he took no
      risks. He kept his grasp firm on the butt of the revolver. Yet, he
      reflected, Yates could surely not meditate an attempt on his weapon, for
      he had, a few minutes before, told him a story about a prisoner who
      escaped in exactly that way. Stoliker was suspicious of the good
      intentions of the man he had in charge; he was altogether too polite and
      good-natured; and, besides, the constable dumbly felt that the prisoner
      was a much cleverer man than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sit up,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not paid to carry you, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What&rsquo;s that? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Yates rapidly, blinking his
      eyes and straightening up. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only you, Stoliker. I thought it was
      my friend Renmark. Have I been asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either that or pretending&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which, and I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I must have been pretending,&rdquo; answered Yates drowsily; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have
      dropped asleep. How long have we been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; And Yates&rsquo; head began to droop again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the constable felt no doubt about it. No man could imitate sleep
      so well. Several times Yates nearly fell forward, and each time saved
      himself, with the usual luck of a sleeper or a drunkard. Nevertheless,
      Stoliker never took his hand from his revolver. Suddenly, with a greater
      lurch than usual, Yates pitched head first down the bank, carrying the
      constable with him. The steel band of the handcuff nipped the wrist of
      Stoliker, who, with an oath and a cry of pain, instinctively grasped the
      links between with his right hand, to save his wrist. Like a cat, Yates
      was upon him, showing marvelous agility for a man who had just tumbled in
      a heap. The next instant he held aloft the revolver, crying triumphantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that, umpire? Out, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constable, with set teeth, still rubbed his wounded wrist, realizing
      the helplessness of a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Stoliker,&rdquo; said Yates, pointing the pistol at him, &ldquo;what have you to
      say before I fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the constable, &ldquo;except that you will be hanged at
      Welland, instead of staying a few days in jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not bad, Stoliker; and I really believe there&rsquo;s
      some grit in you, if you <i>are</i> a man-catcher. Still, you were not in
      very much danger, as perhaps you knew. Now, if you should want this pistol
      again, just watch where it alights.&rdquo; And Yates, taking the weapon by the
      muzzle, tossed it as far as he could into the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker watched its flight intently, then, putting his hand into his
      pocket, he took out some small object and flung it as nearly as he could
      to the spot where the revolver fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that how you mark the place?&rdquo; asked Yates; &ldquo;or is it some spell that
      will enable you to find the pistol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; answered the constable quietly. &ldquo;It is the key of the
      handcuffs. The duplicate is at Welland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates whistled a prolonged note, and looked with admiration at the little
      man. He saw the hopelessness of the situation. If he attempted to search
      for the key in the long grass, the chances were ten to one that Stoliker
      would stumble on the pistol before Yates found the key, in which case the
      reporter would be once more at the mercy of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoliker, you&rsquo;re evidently fonder of my company than I am of yours. That
      wasn&rsquo;t a bad strategic move on your part, but it may cause you some
      personal inconvenience before I get these handcuffs filed off. I&rsquo;m not
      going to Welland this trip, as you may be disappointed to learn. I have
      gone with you as far as I intend to. You will now come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not move,&rdquo; replied the constable firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, stay there,&rdquo; said Yates, twisting his hand around so as to
      grasp the chain that joined the cuffs. Getting a firm grip, he walked up
      the road, down which they had tramped a few minutes before. Stoliker set
      his teeth and tried to hold his ground, but was forced to follow. Nothing
      was said by either until several hundred yards were thus traversed. Then
      Yates stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having now demonstrated to you the fact that you must accompany me, I
      hope you will show yourself a sensible man, Stoliker, and come with me
      quietly. It will be less exhausting for both of us, and all the same in
      the end. You can do nothing until you get help. I am going to see the
      fight, which I feel sure will be a brief one, so I don&rsquo;t want to lose any
      more time in getting back. In order to avoid meeting people, and having me
      explain to them that you are my prisoner, I propose we go through the
      fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One difference between a fool and a wise man is that the wise man always
      accepts the inevitable. The constable was wise. The two crossed the rail
      fence into the fields, and walked along peaceably together&mdash;Stoliker
      silent, as usual, with the grim confidence of a man who is certain of
      ultimate success, who has the nation behind him, with all its machinery
      working in his favor; Yates talkative, argumentative, and instructive by
      turns, occasionally breaking forth into song when the unresponsiveness of
      the other rendered conversation difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoliker, how supremely lovely and quiet and restful are the silent,
      scented, spreading fields! How soothing to a spirit tired of the city&rsquo;s
      din is this solitude, broken only by the singing of the birds and the
      drowsy droning of the bee, erroneously termed &lsquo;bumble&rsquo;! The green fields,
      the shady trees, the sweet freshness of the summer air, untainted by city
      smoke, and over all the eternal serenity of the blue unclouded sky&mdash;how
      can human spite and human passion exist in such a paradise? Does it all
      not make you feel as if you were an innocent child again, with motives
      pure and conscience white?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Stoliker felt like an innocent child, he did not look it. With clouded
      brow he eagerly scanned the empty fields, hoping for help. But, although
      the constable made no reply, there was an answer that electrified Yates,
      and put all thought of the beauty of the country out of his mind. The dull
      report of a musket, far in front of them, suddenly broke the silence,
      followed by several scattering shots, and then the roar of a volley. This
      was sharply answered by the ring of rifles to the right. With an oath,
      Yates broke into a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re at it!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and all on account of your confounded
      obstinacy I shall miss the whole show. The Fenians have opened fire, and
      the Canadians have not been long in replying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The din of the firing now became incessant. The veteran in Yates was
      aroused. He was like an old war horse who again feels the intoxicating
      smell of battle smoke. The lunacy of gunpower shone in his gleaming eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, you loitering idiot!&rdquo; he cried to the constable, who had
      difficulty in keeping pace with him; &ldquo;come on, or, by the gods! I&rsquo;ll break
      your wrist across a fence rail and tear this brutal iron from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The savage face of the prisoner was transformed with the passion of war,
      and, for the first time that day, Stoliker quailed before the insane glare
      of his eyes. But if he was afraid, he did not show his fear to Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, <i>you</i>!&rdquo; he shouted, springing ahead, and giving a twist to
      the handcuffs well known to those who have to deal with refractory
      criminals. &ldquo;I am as eager to see the fight as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sharp pain brought Yates to his senses again. He laughed, and said:
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket, I&rsquo;m with you. Perhaps you would not be in such a hurry
      if you knew that I am going into the thick the fight, and intend to use
      you as a shield from the bullets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered the little constable, panting. &ldquo;Two sides are
      firing. I&rsquo;ll shield you on one side, and you&rsquo;ll have to shield me on the
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Yates laughed, and they ran silently together. Avoiding the houses,
      they came out at the Ridge Road. The smoke rolled up above the trees,
      showing where the battle was going on some distance beyond. Yates made the
      constable cross the fence and the road, and take to the fields again,
      bringing him around behind Bartlett&rsquo;s house and barn. No one was visible
      near the house except Kitty Bartlett, who stood at the back watching, with
      pale and anxious face, the rolling smoke, now and then covering her ears
      with her hands as the sound of an extra loud volley assailed them.
      Stoliker lifted up his voice and shouted for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do that again,&rdquo; cried Yates, clutching him by the throat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      choke you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not need to do it again. The girl heard the cry, turned with a
      frightened look, and was about to fly into the house when she recognized
      the two. Then she came toward them. Yates took his hand away from the
      constable&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your father or your brother?&rdquo; demanded the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is over with Mrs. Howard, who is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I command you, in the name of the Queen, to give no assistance to
      this prisoner, but to do as I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I command you, in the name of the President,&rdquo; cried Yates, &ldquo;to keep
      your mouth shut, and not to address a lady like that. Kitty,&rdquo; he continued
      in a milder tone, &ldquo;could you tell me where to get a file, so that I may
      cut these wrist ornaments? Don&rsquo;t you get it. You are to do nothing. Just
      indicate where the file is. The law mustn&rsquo;t have any hold on you, as it
      seems to have on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make him unlock them?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the villain threw away the key in the fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have done that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The constable caught his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did. I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I saw him unlock them at breakfast. The key was on the end of his
      watch chain. He hasn&rsquo;t thrown that away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a move to take out his watch chain but Yates stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch him. I&rsquo;m playing a lone hand here.&rdquo; He jerked out the chain,
      and the real key dangled from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Stoliker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which to admire most&mdash;your
      cleverness and pluck, my stupidity, or Miss Bartlett&rsquo;s acuteness of
      observation. Can we get into the barn, Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you mustn&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear. I think too much of him. Don&rsquo;t you come in. I&rsquo;ll be out in a
      moment, like the medium from a spiritualistic dark cabinet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Entering the barn, Yates forced the constable up against the square oaken
      post which was part of the framework of the building, and which formed one
      side of the perpendicular ladder that led to the top of the hay mow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Stoliker,&rdquo; he, said solemnly, &ldquo;you realize, of course, that I don&rsquo;t
      want to hurt you yet you also realize that I <i>must</i> hurt you if you
      attempt any tricks. I can&rsquo;t take any risks, please remember that; and
      recollect that, by the time you are free again, I shall be in the State of
      New York. So don&rsquo;t compel me to smash your head against this post.&rdquo; He,
      with some trouble, unlocked the clasp on his own wrist; then, drawing
      Stoliker&rsquo;s right hand around the post, he snapped the same clasp on the
      constable&rsquo;s hitherto free wrist. The unfortunate man, with his cheek
      against the oak, was in the comical position of lovingly embracing the
      post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a chair from the kitchen, so that you will be more
      comfortable&mdash;unless, like Samson, you can pull down the supports.
      Then I must bid you good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates went out to the girl, who was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to borrow a kitchen chair, Kitty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so that poor Stoliker
      will get a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked toward the house. Yates noticed that the firing had ceased,
      except a desultory shot here and there across the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to retreat over the border as quickly as I can,&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;This country is getting too hot for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are much safer here,&rdquo; said the girl, with downcast eyes. &ldquo;A man has
      brought the news that the United States gunboats are sailing up and down
      the river, making prisoners of all who attempt to cross from this side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! Well, I might have known that. Then what am I to do with
      Stoliker? I can&rsquo;t keep him tied up here. Yet the moment he gets loose I&rsquo;m
      done for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps mother could persuade him not to do anything more. Shall I go for
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be any use. Stoliker&rsquo;s a stubborn animal. He has
      suffered too much at my hands to be in a forgiving mood. We&rsquo;ll bring him a
      chair anyhow, and see the effect of kindness on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the chair was placed at Stoliker&rsquo;s disposal, he sat down upon it,
      still hugging the post with an enforced fervency that, in spite of the
      solemnity of the occasion, nearly made Kitty laugh, and lit up her eyes
      with the mischievousness that had always delighted Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long am I to be kept here?&rdquo; asked the constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not long,&rdquo; answered Yates cheerily; &ldquo;not a moment longer than is
      necessary. I&rsquo;ll telegraph when I&rsquo;m safe in New York State; so you won&rsquo;t be
      here more than a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This assurance did not appear to bring much comfort to Stoliker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I guess I know as well as the next man when I&rsquo;m
      beaten. I have been thinking all this over. I am under the sheriff&rsquo;s
      orders, and not under the orders of that officer. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve
      done anything, anyhow, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have acted quite the way you did.
      If the sheriff had sent me, it would have been different. As it is, if you
      unlock those cuffs, I&rsquo;ll give you my word I&rsquo;ll do nothing more unless I&rsquo;m
      ordered to. Like as not they&rsquo;ve forgotten all about you by this time; and
      there&rsquo;s nothing on record, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it? Will you act square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;ll act square. I don&rsquo;t suppose you doubt that. I didn&rsquo;t ask
      any favors before, and I did what I could to hold you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough said,&rdquo; cried Yates. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker stretched his arms wearily above his head when he was released.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, now that Kitty was gone, &ldquo;if there is anything to eat
      in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake!&rdquo; cried Yates, holding out his hand to him. &ldquo;Another great and
      mutual sentiment unites us, Stoliker. Let us go and see.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The man who wanted to see the fight did not see it, and the man who did
      not want to see it saw it. Yates arrived on the field of conflict when all
      was over; Renmark found the battle raging around him before he realized
      that things had reached a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Yates reached the tent, he found it empty and torn by bullets. The
      fortunes of war had smashed the jar, and the fragments were strewn before
      the entrance, probably by some disappointed man who had tried to sample
      the contents and had found nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; said Yates to himself, &ldquo;I wonder what the five assistants
      that the <i>Argus</i> sent me have done with themselves? If they are with
      the Fenians, beating a retreat, or, worse, if they are captured by the
      Canadians, they won&rsquo;t be able to get an account of this scrimmage through
      to the paper. Now, this is evidently the biggest item of the year&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      international, by George! It may involve England and the United States in
      a war, if both sides are not extra mild and cautious. I can&rsquo;t run the
      chance of the paper being left in the lurch. Let me think a minute. Is it
      my tip to follow the Canadians or the Fenians? I wonder is which is
      running the faster? My men are evidently with the Fenians, if they were on
      the ground at all. If I go after the Irish Republic, I shall run the risk
      of duplicating things; but if I follow the Canadians, they may put me
      under arrest. Then we have more Fenian sympathizers among our readers than
      Canadians, so the account from the invasion side of the fence will be the
      more popular. Yet a Canadian version would be a good thing, if I were sure
      the rest of the boys got in their work, and the chances are that the other
      papers won&rsquo;t have any reporters among the Canucks. Heavens! What is a man
      to do? I&rsquo;ll toss up for it. Heads, the Fenians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spun the coin in the air, and caught it. &ldquo;Heads it is! The Fenians are
      my victims. I&rsquo;m camping on their trail, anyhow. Besides, it&rsquo;s safer than
      following the Canadians, even though Stoliker has got my pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tired as he was, he stepped briskly through the forest. The scent of a big
      item was in his nostrils, and it stimulated him like champagne. What was
      temporary loss of sleep compared to the joy of defeating the opposition
      press?
    </p>
    <p>
      A blind man might have followed the trail of the retreating army. They had
      thrown away, as they passed through the woods, every article that impeded
      their progress. Once he came on a man lying with his face in the dead
      leaves. He turned him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His troubles are past, poor devil,&rdquo; said Yates, as he pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! Throw up your hands!&rdquo; came a cry from in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates saw no one, but he promptly threw up his hands, being an adaptable
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m retreating, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then retreat five steps farther. I&rsquo;ll count the steps. One.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates strode one step forward, and then saw that a man behind a tree was
      covering him with a gun. The next step revealed a second captor, with a
      huge upraised hammer, like a Hercules with his club. Both men had
      blackened faces, and resembled thoroughly disreputable fiends of the
      forest. Seated on the ground, in a semicircle, were half a dozen dejected
      prisoners. The man with the gun swore fearfully, but his comrade with the
      hammer was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the marksman, &ldquo;you blank scoundrel, and take a seat with your
      fellow-scoundrels. If you attempt to run, blank blank you, I&rsquo;ll fill you
      full of buckshot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to run, Sandy,&rdquo; cried Yates, recognizing him. &ldquo;Why
      should I? I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed your company, and Macdonald&rsquo;s. How are you,
      Mac? Is this a little private raid of your own? For which side are you
      fighting? And I say, Sandy, what&rsquo;s the weight of that old-fashioned bar of
      iron you have in your hands? I&rsquo;d like to decide a bet. Let me heft it, as
      you said in the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; said Sandy in a disappointed tone, lowering his
      gun. &ldquo;I thought we had raked in another of them. The old man and I want to
      make it an even dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll capture any more. I saw nobody as I came
      through the woods. What are you going to do with this crowd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brain &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said Macdonald laconically, speaking for the first time. Then
      he added reluctantly: &ldquo;If any of &lsquo;em tries to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners were all evidently too tired and despondent to make any
      attempt at regaining their liberty. Sandy winked over Macdonald&rsquo;s shoulder
      at Yates, and by a slight side movement of his head he seemed to indicate
      that he would like to have some private conversation with the newspaper
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your prisoner, am I?&rdquo; asked Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Macdonald. &ldquo;You may go if you like, but not in the direction
      the Fenians have gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I won&rsquo;t need to go any farther, if you will give me permission to
      interview your prisoners. I merely want to get some points about the
      fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the blacksmith, &ldquo;as long as you don&rsquo;t try to help
      them. If you do, I warn you there will be trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates followed Sandy into the depths of the forest, out of hearing of the
      others, leaving Macdonald and his sledge-hammer on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at a safe distance, Sandy stopped and rested his arms on his gun, in
      a pathfinder attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he began anxiously, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t got some powder and shot on you by
      any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not an ounce. Haven&rsquo;t you any ammunition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and haven&rsquo;t had all through the fight. You see, we left the shop in
      such a hurry we never thought about powder and ball. As soon as a man on
      horseback came by shouting that there was a fight on, the old man he
      grabbed his sledge, and I took this gun that had been left at the shop for
      repairs, and off we started. I&rsquo;m not sure that it would shoot if I had
      ammunition, but I&rsquo;d like to try. I&rsquo;ve scared some of them Fee-neens nigh
      to death with it, but I was always afraid one of them would pull a real
      gun on me, and then I don&rsquo;t know just what I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sandy sighed, and added, with the air of a man who saw his mistake, but
      was somewhat loath to acknowledge it: &ldquo;Next battle there is you won&rsquo;t find
      me in it with a lame gun and no powder. I&rsquo;d sooner have the old man&rsquo;s
      sledge. It don&rsquo;t miss fire.&rdquo; His eye brightened as he thought of
      Macdonald. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he continued, with a jerk of his head back over his
      shoulder, &ldquo;the boss is on the warpath in great style, aint he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Yates, &ldquo;but, for that matter, so are you. You can swear
      nearly as well as Macdonald himself. When did you take to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, you see,&rdquo; said Sandy apologetically, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t come as natural
      to me as chewing, but, then, somebody&rsquo;s got to swear. The old man&rsquo;s
      converted, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, hasn&rsquo;t he backslid yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t. I was afraid this scrimmage was going to do for him, but
      it didn&rsquo;t; and now I think that if somebody near by does a little cussing,&mdash;not
      that anyone can cuss like the boss,&mdash;he&rsquo;ll pull through. I think
      he&rsquo;ll stick this time. You&rsquo;d ought to have seen him wading into them d&mdash;d
      Fee-neens, swinging his sledge, and singing &lsquo;Onward, Christian soldiers.&rsquo; 
      Then, with me to chip in a cuss word now and again when things got hot, he
      pulled through the day without ripping an oath. I tell you, it was a
      sight. He bowled &lsquo;em over like nine-pins. You ought to &lsquo;a&rsquo; been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Yates regretfully. &ldquo;I missed it, all on account of that
      accursed Stoliker. Well, there&rsquo;s no use crying over spilled milk, but I&rsquo;ll
      tell you one thing, Sandy: although I have no ammunition, I&rsquo;ll let you
      know what I have got. I have, in my pocket, one of the best plugs of
      tobacco that you ever put your teeth into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sandy&rsquo;s eyes glittered. &ldquo;Bless you!&rdquo; was all he could say, as he bit off a
      corner of the offered plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Sandy, there are compensations in this life, after all; I
      thought you were out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a bite all day. That&rsquo;s the trouble with leaving in a
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may keep that plug, with my regards. Now, I want to get back
      and interview those fellows. There&rsquo;s no time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the group, Macdonald said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a man says he knows you, Mr. Yates. He claims he is a reporter,
      and that you will vouch for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates strode forward, and looked anxiously at the prisoners, hoping, yet
      fearing, to find one of his own men there. He was a selfish man, and
      wanted the glory of the day to be all his own. He soon recognized one of
      the prisoners as Jimmy Hawkins of the staff of a rival daily, the New York
      <i>Blade</i>. This was even worse than he had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jimmy!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how did you get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was raked in by that adjective fool with the unwashed face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose a&mdash;fool?&rdquo; cried Macdonald in wrath, and grasping his hammer.
      He boggled slightly as he came to the &ldquo;adjective,&rdquo; but got over it safely.
      It was evidently a close call, but Sandy sprang to the rescue, and cursed
      Hawkins until even the prisoners turned pale at the torrent of profanity.
      Macdonald looked with sad approbation at his pupil, not knowing that he
      was under the stimulus of newly acquired tobacco, wondering how he had
      attained such proficiency in malediction; for, like all true artists, he
      was quite unconscious of his own merit in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell this hammer wielder that I&rsquo;m no anvil. Tell him that I&rsquo;m a newspaper
      man, and didn&rsquo;t come here to fight. He says that if you guarantee that I&rsquo;m
      no Fenian he&rsquo;ll let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates sat down on a fallen log, with a frown on his brow. He liked to do a
      favor to a fellow-creature when the act did not inconvenience himself, but
      he never forgot the fact that business was business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t conscientiously tell him that, Jimmy,&rdquo; said Yates soothingly.
      &ldquo;How am I to know you are not a Fenian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; cried Hawkins angrily. &ldquo;Conscientiously? A lot you think of
      conscience when there is an item to be had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We none of us live up to our better nature, Jimmy,&rdquo; continued Yates
      feelingly. &ldquo;We can but do our best, which is not much. For reasons that
      you might fail to understand, I do not wish to run the risk of telling a
      lie. You appreciate my hesitation, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Macdonald? You would not
      advise me to assert a thing I was not sure of, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said the blacksmith earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to keep me here because you are afraid of me,&rdquo; cried the
      indignant <i>Blade</i> man. &ldquo;You know very well I&rsquo;m not a Fenian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Jimmy, but I know nothing of the kind. I even suspect myself
      of Fenian leanings. How, then, can I be sure of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo; asked Hawkins more calmly, for he realized that he
      himself would not be slow to take advantage of a rival&rsquo;s dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My game is to get a neat little account of this historical episode sent
      over the wires to the <i>Argus</i>. You see, Jimmy, this is my busy day.
      When the task is over, I will devote myself to your service, and will save
      you from being hanged, if I can; although I shall do so without prejudice,
      as the lawyers say, for I have always held that that will be the ultimate
      end of all the <i>Blade</i> staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Yates; play fair. Don&rsquo;t run in any conscientious guff on a
      prisoner. You see, I have known you these many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and little have you profited by a noble example. It is your
      knowledge of me that makes me wonder at your expecting me to let you out
      of your hole without due consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you willing to make a bargain?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always&mdash;when the balance of trade is on my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you give me a fair start, I&rsquo;ll give you some exclusive
      information that you can&rsquo;t get otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t born yesterday, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is interesting information, Jimmy, but I knew it before. Haven&rsquo;t you
      something more attractive to offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have. I have the whole account of the expedition and the fight
      written out, all ready to send, if I could get my clutches on a telegraph
      wire. I&rsquo;ll hand it over to you, and allow you to read it, if you will get
      me out of this hole, as you call it. I&rsquo;ll give you permission to use the
      information in any way you choose, if you will extricate me, and all I ask
      is a fair start in the race for a telegraph office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates pondered over the proposition for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Jimmy,&rdquo; he finally said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy that
      account from you, and give you more money than the <i>Blade</i> will. And
      when I get back to New York I&rsquo;ll place you on the staff of the <i>Argus</i>
      at a higher salary than the <i>Blade</i> gives you&mdash;taking your own
      word for the amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! And leave my paper in the lurch? Not likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your paper is going to be left in the lurch, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But it won&rsquo;t be sold by me. I&rsquo;ll burn my copy before I will let
      you have a glimpse of it. That don&rsquo;t need to interfere with your making me
      an offer of a better position when we get back to New York; but while my
      paper depends on me, I won&rsquo;t go back on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you please, Jimmy. Perhaps I would do the same myself. I always
      was weak where the interests of the <i>Argus</i> were concerned. You
      haven&rsquo;t any blank paper you could lend me, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, but I won&rsquo;t lend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates took out his pencil, and pulled down his cuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mac,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me all you saw of this fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith talked, and Yates listened, putting now and then a mark on
      his cuff. Sandy spoke occasionally, but it was mostly to tell of
      sledge-hammer feats or to corroborate something the boss said. One after
      another Yates interviewed the prisoners, and gathered together all the
      materials for that excellent full-page account &ldquo;by an eyewitness&rdquo; that
      afterward appeared in the columns of the <i>Argus</i>. He had a wonderful
      memory, and simply jotted down figures with which he did not care to
      burden his mind. Hawkins laughed derisively now and then at the facts they
      were giving Yates, but the <i>Argus</i> man said nothing, merely setting
      down in shorthand some notes of the information Hawkins sneered at, which
      Yates considered was more than likely accurate and important. When he had
      got all he wanted, he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I send you help, Mac?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the smith; &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take these fellows to the shop, and
      hold them there till called for. You can&rsquo;t vouch for Hawkins, then, Mr.
      Yates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens, no! I look on him as the most dangerous of the lot. These
      half-educated criminals, who have no conscientious scruples, always seem
      to me a greater menace to society than their more ignorant
      co-conspirators. Well, good-by, Jimmy. I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy life down at
      Mac&rsquo;s shop. It&rsquo;s the best place I&rsquo;ve struck since I&rsquo;ve been in the
      district. Give my love to all the boys, when they come to gaze at you.
      I&rsquo;ll make careful inquiries into your opinions, and as soon as I am
      convinced that you can be set free with safety to the community I&rsquo;ll drop
      in on you and do all I can. Meanwhile, so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates&rsquo; one desire now was to reach a telegraph office, and write his
      article as it was being clicked off on the machine. He had his fears about
      the speed of a country operator, but he dared not risk trying to get
      through to Buffalo in the then excited state of the country. He quickly
      made up his mind to go to the Bartlett place, borrow a horse, if the
      Fenians had not permanently made off with them all, and ride as rapidly as
      he could for the nearest telegraph office. He soon reached the edge of the
      woods, and made his way across the fields to the house. He found young
      Bartlett at the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news of the horses yet?&rdquo; was the first question he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said young Bartlett gloomily; &ldquo;guess they&rsquo;ve rode away with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must get a horse from somewhere to ride to the telegraph office.
      Where is the likeliest place to find one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you can get one, unless you steal the telegraph boy&rsquo;s
      nag; it&rsquo;s in the stable now, having a feed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What telegraph boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you see him? He went out to the tent to look for you, and I
      thought he had found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t been at the tent for ever so long. Perhaps he has some news
      for me. I&rsquo;m going to the house to write, so send him in as soon as he gets
      back. Be sure you don&rsquo;t let him get away before I see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lock the stable,&rdquo; said young Bartlett, &ldquo;and then he won&rsquo;t get the
      horse, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates found Kitty in the kitchen, and he looked so flurried that the girl
      cried anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they after you again, Mr. Yates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Kitty; I&rsquo;m after them. Say, I want all the blank paper you have in
      the house. Anything will do, so long as it will hold a lead-pencil mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A copy book&mdash;such as the children use in school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In less than a minute the energetic girl had all the materials he required
      ready for him in the front room. Yates threw off his coat, and went to
      work as if he were in his own den in the <i>Argus</i> building.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a &mdash;&mdash; of a vacation,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, as he
      drove his pencil at lightning speed over the surface of the paper. He took
      no note of the time until he had finished; then he roused himself and
      sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in thunder has become of that telegraph boy?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Well, it
      doesn&rsquo;t matter; I&rsquo;ll take the horse without his permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gathered up his sheets, and rushed for the kitchen. He was somewhat
      surprised to see the boy sitting there, gorging himself with the good
      things which that kitchen always afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, youngster! how long have you been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let him go in to disturb you while you were writing,&rdquo; said
      Kitty, the boy&rsquo;s mouth being too full to permit of a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that was right. Now, sonny, gulp that down and come in here; I want
      to talk to you for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy followed him into the front room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my son, I want to borrow your horse for the rest of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; said the boy promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have it? I must have it. Why, I&rsquo;ll take it. You don&rsquo;t imagine you
      can stop me, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy drew himself up, and folded his arms across his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want with the horse, Mr. Yates?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get to the nearest telegraph office. I&rsquo;ll pay you well for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to eat, of course. They&rsquo;ll feed you high while you wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canadian telegraph office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Mr. Yates. Them Canadians couldn&rsquo;t telegraph all you&rsquo;ve
      written in two weeks. I know &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said the boy with infinite scorn.
      &ldquo;Besides, the Government has got hold of all the wires, and you can&rsquo;t get
      a private message through till it gets over its fright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; cried Yates, taken aback, &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. Are you
      sure, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s to be done? I must get through to Buffalo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t. United States troops won&rsquo;t let you. They&rsquo;re stopping everybody&mdash;except
      me,&rdquo; he added, drawing himself up, as if he were the one individual who
      stood in with the United States Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get this dispatch through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! That&rsquo;s why I came back. I knew, as soon as I looked at you, that
      you would write two or three columns of telegraph; and your paper said
      &lsquo;Spare no expense,&rsquo; you remember. So says I to myself: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll help Mr.
      Yates to spare no expense. I&rsquo;ll get fifty dollars from that young man,
      seeing I&rsquo;m the only person who can get across in time.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were mighty sure of it, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just bet I was. Now, the horse is fed and ready, I&rsquo;m fed and ready,
      and we&rsquo;re losing valuable time waiting for that fifty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you meet another newspaper man who wants to get his dispatch
      through to another paper, what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charge him the same as I do you. If I meet two other newspaper men, that
      will be one hundred and fifty dollars; but if you want to make sure that I
      won&rsquo;t meet any more newspaper men, let us call it one hundred dollars, and
      I&rsquo;ll take the risk of the odd fifty for the ready cash; then if I meet a
      dozen newspaper men, I&rsquo;ll tell them I&rsquo;m a telegraph boy on a vacation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. I think you will be able to take care of yourself in a cold and
      callous world. Now, look here, young man; I&rsquo;ll trust you if you&rsquo;ll trust
      me. I&rsquo;m not a traveling mint, you know. Besides, I pay by results. If you
      don&rsquo;t get this dispatch through, you don&rsquo;t get anything. I&rsquo;ll give you an
      order for a hundred dollars, and as soon as I get to Buffalo I&rsquo;ll pay you
      the cash. I&rsquo;ll have to draw on the <i>Argus</i> when I get to Buffalo; if
      my article has appeared, you get your cash; if it hasn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re out.
      See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see. It won&rsquo;t do, Mr. Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t it do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I say it won&rsquo;t. This is a cash transaction. Money down, or you
      don&rsquo;t get the goods. I&rsquo;ll get it through all right, but if I just miss,
      I&rsquo;m not going to lose the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll take it to the Canadian telegraph office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Yates. I&rsquo;m disappointed in you. I thought you were some
      good. You aint got no sense, but I wish you luck. When I was at your tent,
      there was a man with a hammer taking a lot of men out of the woods. When
      one of them sees my uniform, he sings out he&rsquo;d give me twenty-five dollars
      to take his stuff. I said I&rsquo;d see him later, and I will. Good-by, Mr.
      Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, there! You&rsquo;re a young villain. You&rsquo;ll end in state&rsquo;s prison yet,
      but here&rsquo;s your money. Now, you ride like a house a-fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After watching the departing boy until he was out of sight Yates, with a
      feeling of relief, started back to the tent. He was worried about the
      interview the boy had had with Hawkins, and he wondered, now that it was
      too late, whether, after all, he had not Hawkins&rsquo; manuscript in his
      pocket. He wished he had searched him. That trouble, however, did not
      prevent him from sleeping like the dead the moment he lay down in the
      tent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The result of the struggle was similar in effect to an American railway
      accident of the first class. One officer and five privates were killed on
      the Canadian side, one man was missing, and many were wounded. The number
      of the Fenians killed will probably never be known. Several were buried on
      the field of battle, others were taken back by O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s brigade when they
      retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the engagement ended as Yates had predicted, yet he was wrong in
      his estimate of the Canadians. Volunteers are invariably underrated by men
      of experience in military matters. The boys fought well, even when they
      saw their ensign fall dead before them. If the affair had been left
      entirely in their hands, the result might have been different&mdash;as was
      shown afterward, when the volunteers, unimpeded by regulars, quickly put
      down a much more formidable rising in the Northwest. But in the present
      case they were hampered by their dependence on the British troops, whose
      commander moved them with all the ponderous slowness of real war, and
      approached O&rsquo;Neill as if he had been approaching Napoleon. He thus managed
      to get in a day after the fair on every occasion, being too late for the
      fight at Ridgeway, and too late to capture any considerable number of the
      flying Fenians at Fort Erie. The campaign, on the Canadian side, was
      magnificently planned and wretchedly carried out. The volunteers and
      regulars were to meet at a point close to where the fight took place, but
      the British commander delayed two hours in starting, which fact the
      Canadian colonel did not learn until too late. These blunders culminated
      in a ghastly mistake on the field. The Canadian colonel ordered his men to
      charge across an open field, and attack the Fenian force in the woods&mdash;a
      brilliant but foolish move. To the command the volunteers gallantly
      responded, but against stupidity the gods are powerless. In the field they
      were appalled to hear the order given to form square and receive cavalry.
      Even the schoolboys knew the Fenians could have no cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having formed their square, the Canadians found themselves the helpless
      targets of the Fenians in the woods. If O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s forces had shot with
      reasonable precision, they must have cut the volunteers to pieces. The
      latter were victorious, if they had only known it; but, in this hopeless
      square, panic seized them, and it was every man for himself; at the same
      time, the Fenians were also retreating as fast as they could. This farce
      is known as the battle of Ridgeway, and would have been comical had it not
      been that death hovered over it. The comedy, without the tragedy, was
      enacted a day or two before at a bloodless skirmish which took place near
      a hamlet called Waterloo, which affray is dignified in Canadian annals as
      the second battle of that name.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Canadian forces retreated, Renmark, who had watched the contest
      with all the helpless anxiety of a noncombatant, sharing the danger, but
      having no influence upon the result, followed them, making a wide detour
      to avoid the chance shots which were still flying. He expected to come up
      with the volunteers on the road, but was not successful. Through various
      miscalculations he did not succeed in finding them until toward evening.
      At first they told him that young Howard was with the company, and unhurt,
      but further inquiry soon disclosed the fact that he had not been seen
      since the fight. He was not among those who were killed or wounded, and it
      was nightfall before Renmark realized that opposite his name on the roll
      would be placed the ominous word &ldquo;missing.&rdquo; Renmark remembered that the
      boy had said he would visit his home if he got leave; but no leave had
      been asked for. At last Renmark was convinced that young Howard was either
      badly wounded or dead. The possibility of his desertion the professor did
      not consider for a moment, although he admitted to himself that it was
      hard to tell what panic of fear might come over a boy who, for the first
      time in his life, found bullets flying about his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy heart Renmark turned back and made his way to the fatal
      field. He found nothing on the Canadian side. Going over to the woods, he
      came across several bodies lying where they fell; but they were all those
      of strangers. Even in the darkness he would have had no difficulty in
      recognizing the volunteer uniform which he knew so well. He walked down to
      the Howard homestead, hoping, yet fearing, to hear the boy&rsquo;s voice&mdash;the
      voice of a deserter. Everything was silent about the house, although a
      light shone through an upper window, and also through one below. He paused
      at the gate, not knowing what to do. It was evident the boy was not here,
      yet how to find the father or brother, without alarming Margaret or her
      mother, puzzled him. As he stood there the door opened, and he recognized
      Mrs. Bartlett and Margaret standing in the light. He moved away from the
      gate, and heard the older woman say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she will be all right in the morning, now that she has fallen into a
      nice sleep. I wouldn&rsquo;t disturb her to-night, if I were you. It is nothing
      but nervousness and fright at that horrible firing. It&rsquo;s all over now,
      thank God. Good-night, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good woman came through the gate, and then ran, with all the speed of
      sixteen, toward her own home. Margaret stood in the doorway, listening to
      the retreating footsteps. She was pale and anxious, but Renmark thought he
      had never seen anyone so lovely; and he was startled to find that he had a
      most un-professor-like longing to take her in his arms and comfort her.
      Instead of bringing her consolation, he feared it would be his fate to add
      to her anxiety; and it was not until he saw she was about to close the
      door that he found courage to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had never heard her name pronounced in that tone before, and the
      cadence of it went direct to her heart, frightening her with an unknown
      joy. She seemed unable to move or respond, and stood there, with wide eyes
      and suspended breath, gazing into the darkness. Renmark stepped into the
      light, and she saw his face was haggard with fatigue and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;I want to speak with you a moment. Where is
      your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone with Mr. Bartlett to see if he can find the horses. There is
      something wrong,&rdquo; she continued, stepping down beside him. &ldquo;I can see it
      in your face. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your father in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he is worried about mother. Tell me what it is. It is better to
      tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me in suspense like this,&rdquo; cried the girl in a low but intense
      voice. &ldquo;You have said too much or too little. Has anything happened to
      Henry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is about Arthur I wanted to speak. You will not be alarmed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> alarmed. Tell, me quickly.&rdquo; And the girl in her excitement
      laid her hands imploringly on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur joined the volunteers in Toronto some time ago. Did you know
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never told me. I understand&mdash;I think so, but I hope not. He was
      in the battle today. Is he&mdash;has he been&mdash;hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; said Renmark hurriedly, now that the truth
      had to come out; he realized, by the nervous tightening of the girl&rsquo;s
      unconscious grasp, how clumsily he was telling it. &ldquo;He was with the
      volunteers this morning. He is not with them now. They don&rsquo;t know where he
      is. No one saw him hurt, but it is feared he was, and that he has been
      left behind. I have been all over the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I could not find him. I came here hoping to find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me to where the volunteers were,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I know what has
      happened. Come quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not put something on your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Come at once.&rdquo; Then, pausing, she said: &ldquo;Shall we need a
      lantern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is light enough when we get out from the shadow of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret ran along the road so swiftly that Renmark had some trouble in
      keeping pace with her. She turned at the side road, and sped up the gentle
      ascent to the spot where the volunteers had crossed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the place,&rdquo; said Renmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could not have been hit in the field,&rdquo; she cried breathlessly, &ldquo;for
      then he might have reached the house at the corner without climbing a
      fence. If he was badly hurt, he would have been here. Did you search this
      field?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every bit of it. He is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must have happened after he crossed the road and the second
      fence. Did you see the battle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the Fenians cross the field after the volunteers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they did not leave the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if he was struck, it could not have been far from the other side of
      the second fence. He would be the last to retreat; and that is why the
      others did not see him,&rdquo; said the girl, with confident pride in her
      brother&rsquo;s courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the first fence; the road, and the second fence, the girl
      walking ahead for a few paces. She stopped, and leaned for a moment
      against a tree. &ldquo;It must have been about here,&rdquo; she said in a voice hardly
      audible. &ldquo;Have you searched on this side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for half a mile farther into the fields and woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not there; but down along the fence. He knew every inch of this
      ground. If he were wounded here, he would at once try to reach our house.
      Search down along the fence. I&mdash;I cannot go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark walked along the fence, peering into the dark corners made by the
      zigzag of the rails; and he knew, without looking back, that Margaret,
      with feminine inconsistency, was following him. Suddenly she darted past
      him, and flung herself down in the long grass, wailing out a cry that cut
      Renmark like a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy lay with his face in the grass, and his outstretched hand grasping
      the lower rail of the fence. He had dragged himself this far, and reached
      an insurmountable obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark drew the weeping girl gently away, and rapidly ran his hand over
      the prostrate lad. He quickly opened his tunic, and a thrill of joy passed
      over him as he felt the faint beating of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is alive!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He will get well, Margaret.&rdquo; A statement
      somewhat premature to make on so hasty an examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, expecting a look of gratitude from the girl he loved. He was
      amazed to see her eyes almost luminous in the darkness, blazing with
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you know he was with the volunteers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning&mdash;early,&rdquo; said the professor, taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me not to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a mere boy. You are a man, and ought to have a man&rsquo;s sense. You had
      no right to mind what a boy said. It was my right to know, and your duty
      to tell me. Through your negligence and stupidity my brother has lain here
      all day&mdash;perhaps dying,&rdquo; she added with a break in her angry voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had known&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know anything was wrong until I saw the
      volunteers. I have not lost a moment since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have known he was missing, without going to the volunteers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark was so amazed at the unjust accusation, from a girl whom he had
      made the mistake of believing to be without a temper of her own, that he
      knew not what to say. He was, however, to have one more example of
      inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stand there doing nothing, now that I have found him?&rdquo; she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on his tongue to say: &ldquo;I stand here because you stand there
      unjustly quarreling with me,&rdquo; but he did not say it. Renmark was not a
      ready man, yet he did, for once, the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;throw down that fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This curt command, delivered in his most schoolmastery manner, was
      instantly obeyed. Such a task may seem a formidable one to set to a young
      woman, but it is a feat easily accomplished in some parts of America. A
      rail fence lends itself readily to demolition. Margaret tossed a rail to
      the right, one to the left, and to the right again, until an open gap took
      the place of that part of the fence. The professor examined the young
      soldier in the meantime, and found his leg had been broken by a musket
      ball. He raised him up tenderly in his arms, and was pleased to hear a
      groan escape his lips. He walked through the open gap and along the road
      toward the house, bearing the unconscious form of his pupil. Margaret
      silently kept close to his side, her fingers every now and then
      unconsciously caressing the damp, curly locks of her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to get a doctor?&rdquo; Her assertion was half an inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not disturb anyone in the house. It is better that I should tell
      you what to do now, so that we need not talk when we reach there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot help disturbing someone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it will be necessary. If you will stay with Arthur, I will
      go for the doctor, and no one need know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go for the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know the way. It is five or six miles. I will ride Gypsy, and
      will soon be back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are prowlers and stragglers all along the roads. It is not safe
      for you to go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly safe. No horse that the stragglers have stolen can
      overtake Gypsy. Now, don&rsquo;t say anything more. It is best that I should go.
      I will run on ahead, and enter the house quietly. I will take the lamp to
      the room at the side, where the window opens to the floor. Carry him
      around there. I will be waiting for you at the gate, and will show you the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the girl was off, and Renmark carried his burden alone. She was
      waiting for him at the gate, and silently led the way round the house, to
      where the door-window opened upon the bit of lawn under an apple tree. The
      light streamed out upon the grass. He placed the boy gently upon the
      dainty bed. It needed no second glance to tell Renmark whose room he was
      in. It was decorated with those pretty little knickknacks so dear to the
      heart of a girl in a snuggery she can call her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not likely you will be disturbed here,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;until I
      come back. I will tap at the window when I come with the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be better and safer for me to go? I don&rsquo;t like
      the thought of your going alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Please do just what I tell you. You do not know the way. I shall
      be very much quicker. If Arthur should&mdash;should&mdash;wake, he will
      know you, and will not be alarmed, as he might be if you were a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was gone before he could say anything more, and Renmark sat down,
      devoutly hoping no one would rap at the door of the room while he was
      there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret spoke caressingly to her horse, when she opened the stable door,
      and Gypsy replied with that affectionate, low guttural whinny which the
      Scotch graphically term &ldquo;nickering.&rdquo; She patted the little animal; and if
      Gypsy was surprised at being saddled and bridled at that hour of the
      night, no protest was made, the horse merely rubbing its nose lovingly up
      and down Margaret&rsquo;s sleeve as she buckled the different straps. There was
      evidently a good understanding between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Gyp,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I have nothing for you to-night&mdash;nothing
      but hard work and quick work. Now, you mustn&rsquo;t make a noise till we get
      past the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On her wrist she slipped the loop of a riding whip, which she always
      carried, but never used. Gyp had never felt the indignity of the lash, and
      was always willing to do what was required merely for a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret opened the big gate before she saddled her horse, and there was
      therefore no delay in getting out upon the main road, although the passing
      of the house was an anxious moment. She feared that if her father heard
      the steps or the neighing of the horse he might come out to investigate.
      Halfway between her own home and Bartlett&rsquo;s house she sprang lightly into
      the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No second word was required. Away they sped down the road toward the east,
      the mild June air coming sweet and cool and fresh from the distant lake,
      laden with the odors of the woods and the fields. The stillness was
      intense, broken only by the plaintive cry of the whippoorwill, America&rsquo;s
      one-phrased nightingale, or the still more weird and eerie note of a
      distant loon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The houses along the road seemed deserted; no lights were shown anywhere.
      The wildest rumors were abroad concerning the slaughter of the day; and
      the population, scattered as it was, appeared to have retired into its
      shell. A spell of silence and darkness was over the land, and the rapid
      hoof beats of the horse sounded with startling distinctness on the harder
      portions of the road, emphasized by intervals of complete stillness, when
      the fetlocks sank in the sand and progress was more difficult for the
      plucky little animal. The only thrill of fear that Margaret felt on her
      night journey was when she entered the dark arch of an avenue of old
      forest trees that bordered the road, like a great, gloomy cathedral aisle,
      in the shadow of which anything might be hidden. Once the horse, with a
      jump of fear, started sideways and plunged ahead: Margaret caught her
      breath as she saw, or fancied she saw, several men stretched on the
      roadside, asleep or dead. Once in the open again she breathed more freely,
      and if it had not been for the jump of the horse, she would have accused
      her imagination of playing her a trick. Just as she had completely
      reassured herself a shadow moved from the fence to the middle of the road,
      and a sharp voice cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little horse, as if it knew the meaning of the word, planted its two
      front hoofs together, and slid along the ground for a moment, coming so
      quickly to a standstill that it was with some difficulty Margaret kept her
      seat. She saw in front of her a man holding a gun, evidently ready to fire
      if she attempted to disobey his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, and where are you going?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please let me pass!&rdquo; pleaded Margaret with a tremor of fear in her
      voice. &ldquo;I am going for a doctor&mdash;for my brother; he is badly wounded,
      and will perhaps die if I am delayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he cried, coming closer; &ldquo;a woman, is it? and a young one, too, or
      I&rsquo;m a heathen. Now, miss or missus, you get down. I&rsquo;ll have to investigate
      this. The brother business won&rsquo;t work with an old soldier. It&rsquo;s your lover
      you&rsquo;re riding for at this time of the night, or I&rsquo;m no judge of the sex.
      Just slip down, my lady, and see if you don&rsquo;t like me better than him;
      remember that all cats are black in the dark. Get down, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are a soldier, you will let me go. My brother is badly wounded. I
      must get to the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;must&rsquo; with a bayonet in front of you. If he has been wounded,
      there&rsquo;s plenty of better men killed to-day. Come down, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret gathered up the bridle rein, but, even in the darkness, the man
      saw her intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t escape, my pretty. If you try it, you&rsquo;ll not be hurt, but I&rsquo;ll
      kill your horse. If you move, I&rsquo;ll put a bullet through him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill my horse?&rdquo; breathed Margaret in horror, a fear coming over her that
      she had not felt at the thought of danger to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, missy,&rdquo; said the man, approaching nearer, and laying his hand on
      Gypsy&rsquo;s bridle. &ldquo;But there will be no need of that. Besides, it would make
      too much noise, and might bring us company, which would be inconvenient.
      So come down quietly, like the nice little girl you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will let me go and tell the doctor, I will come back here and be
      your prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed again in low, tantalizing tones. This was a good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sweetheart. I wasn&rsquo;t born so recently as all that. A girl in the
      hand is worth a dozen a mile up the road. Now, come off that horse, or
      I&rsquo;ll take you off. This is war time, and I&rsquo;m not going to waste any more
      pretty talk on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, who, she now saw, was hatless, leered up at her, and something in
      his sinister eyes made the girl quail. She had been so quiet that he
      apparently was not prepared for any sudden movement. Her right hand,
      hanging down at her side, had grasped the short riding whip, and, with a
      swiftness that gave him no chance to ward off the blow, she struck him one
      stinging, blinding cut across the eyes, and then brought down the lash on
      the flank of her horse, drawing the animal round with her left over her
      enemy. With a wild snort of astonishment, the horse sprang forward,
      bringing man and gun down to the ground with a clatter that woke the
      echoes; then, with an indignant toss of the head, Gyp sped along the road
      like the wind. It was the first time he had ever felt the cut of a whip,
      and the blow was not forgiven. Margaret, fearing further obstruction on
      the road, turned her horse&rsquo;s head toward the rail fence, and went over it
      like a bird. In the field, where fast going in the dark had dangers,
      Margaret tried to slacken the pace, but the little horse would not have it
      so. He shook his head angrily whenever he thought of the indignity of that
      blow, while Margaret leaned over and tried to explain and beg pardon for
      her offense. The second fence was crossed with a clean-cut leap, and only
      once in the next field did the horse stumble, but quickly recovered and
      went on at the same breakneck gait. The next fence, gallantly vaulted
      over, brought them to the side road, half a mile up which stood the
      doctor&rsquo;s house. Margaret saw the futility of attempting a reconciliation
      until the goal was won. There, with difficulty, the horse was stopped, and
      the girl struck the panes of the upper window, through which a light
      shone, with her riding whip. The window was raised, and the situation
      speedily explained to the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be with you in a moment,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Margaret slid from the saddle, and put her arms around the neck of
      the trembling horse. Gypsy would have nothing to do with her, and sniffed
      the air with offended dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>was</i> a shame, Gyp,&rdquo; she cried, almost tearfully, stroking the
      glossy neck of her resentful friend; &ldquo;it was, it was, and I know it; but
      what was I to do, Gyp? You were the only protector I had, and you <i>did</i>
      bowl him over beautifully; no other horse could have done it so well. It&rsquo;s
      wicked, but I do hope you hurt him, just because I had to strike you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gypsy was still wrathful, and indicated by a toss of the head that the
      wheedling of a woman did not make up for a blow. It was the insult more
      than the pain; and from her&mdash;there was the sting of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I know just how you feel, Gypsy dear; and I don&rsquo;t blame you
      for being angry. I might have spoken to you, of course, but there was no
      time to think, and it was really him I was striking. That&rsquo;s why it came
      down so hard. If I had said a word, he would have got out of the way,
      coward that he was, and then would have shot you&mdash;<i>you</i>, Gypsy!
      Think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If a man can be molded in any shape that pleases a clever woman, how can a
      horse expect to be exempt from her influence. Gypsy showed signs of
      melting, whinnying softly and forgivingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it will never happen again, Gypsy&mdash;never, never. As soon as we
      are safe home again I will burn that whip. You little pet, I knew you
      wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gypsy&rsquo;s head rested on Margaret&rsquo;s shoulder, and we must draw a veil over
      the reconciliation. Some things are too sacred for a mere man to meddle
      with. The friends were friends once more, and on the altar of friendship
      the unoffending whip was doubtless offered as a burning sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor came out, Margaret explained the danger of the road, and
      proposed that they should return by the longer and northern way&mdash;the
      Concession, as it was called.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met no one on the silent road, and soon they saw the light in the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and the girl left their horses tied some distance from the
      house, and walked together to the window with the stealthy steps of a pair
      of housebreakers. Margaret listened breathlessly at the closed window, and
      thought she heard the low murmur of conversation. She tapped lightly on
      the pane, and the professor threw back the door-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were getting very anxious about you,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Peggy!&rdquo; said the boy, with a wan smile, raising his head slightly
      from the pillow and dropping it back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret stooped over and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy! what a fright you have given me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Margery, think what a fright I got myself. I thought I was going to
      die within sight of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gently pushed Margaret from the room. Renmark waited until the
      examination was over, and then went out to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang forward to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is nothing to fear. He has been
      exhausted by loss of blood, but a few days&rsquo; quiet will set that right.
      Then all you will have to contend against will be his impatience at being
      kept to his room, which may be necessary for some weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad! and&mdash;and I am so much obliged to you, Mr.
      Renmark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done nothing&mdash;except make blunders,&rdquo; replied the professor
      with a bitterness that surprised and hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that? You have done everything. We owe his life to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark said nothing for a moment. Her unjust accusation in the earlier
      part of the night had deeply pained him, and he hoped for some hint of
      disclaimer from her. Belonging to the stupider sex, he did not realize
      that the words were spoken in a state of intense excitement and fear, that
      another woman would probably have expressed her condition of mind by
      fainting instead of talking, and that the whole episode had left
      absolutely no trace on the recollection of Margaret. At last Renmark
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be getting back to the tent, if it still exists. I think I had an
      appointment there with Yates some twelve hours ago, but up to this moment
      I had forgotten it. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret stood for a few moments alone, and wondered what she had done to
      offend him. He stumbled along the dark road, not heeding much the
      direction he took, but automatically going the nearest way to the tent.
      Fatigue and the want of sleep were heavy upon him, and his feet were as
      lead. Although dazed, he was conscious of a dull ache where his heart was
      supposed to be, and he vaguely hoped he had not made a fool of himself. He
      entered the tent, and was startled by the voice of Yates:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! hello! Is that you, Stoliker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is Renmark. Are you asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I have been. Hunger is the one sensation of the moment. Have you
      provided anything to eat within the last twenty-four hours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bag full of potatoes here, I believe. I haven&rsquo;t been near the
      tent since early morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; only don&rsquo;t expect a recommendation from me as cook. I&rsquo;m not
      yet hungry enough for raw potatoes. What time has it got to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems as if I had been asleep for weeks. I&rsquo;m the latest edition of Rip
      Van Winkle, and expect to find my mustache gray in the morning. I was
      dreaming sweetly of Stoliker when you fell over the bunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wide enough awake to remember. I <i>think</i> I killed him, but
      wouldn&rsquo;t be sure. So many of my good resolutions go wrong that very likely
      he is alive at this moment. Ask me in the morning. What have you been
      prowling after all night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. Renmark was evidently asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask <i>you</i> in the morning,&rdquo; muttered Yates drowsily&mdash;after
      which there was silence in the tent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yates had stubbornly refused to give up his search for rest and quiet in
      spite of the discomfort of living in a leaky and battered tent. He
      expressed regret that he had not originally camped in the middle of
      Broadway, as being a quieter and less exciting spot than the place he had
      chosen; but, having made the choice, he was going to see the last dog
      hung, he said. Renmark had become less and less of a comrade. He was
      silent, and almost as gloomy as Hiram Bartlett himself. When Yates tried
      to cheer him up by showing him how much worse another man&rsquo;s position might
      be, Renmark generally ended the talk by taking to the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just reflect on my position,&rdquo; Yates would say. &ldquo;Here I am dead in love
      with two lovely girls, both of whom are merely waiting for the word. To
      one of them I have nearly committed myself, which fact, to a man of my
      temperament, inclines me somewhat to the other. Here I am anxious to
      confide in you, and yet I feel that I risk a fight every time I talk about
      the complication. You have no sympathy for me, Renny, when I need
      sympathy; while I am bubbling over with sympathy for you, and you won&rsquo;t
      have it. Now, what would you do if you were in my fix? If you would take
      five minutes and show me clearly which of the two girls I really ought to
      marry, it would help me ever so much, for then I would be sure to settle
      on the other. It is the indecision that is slowly but surely sapping my
      vitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Renmark would have pulled his soft felt hat over his eyes,
      and, muttering words that would have echoed strangely in the silent halls
      of the university building, would plunge into the forest. Yates generally
      looked after his retreating figure without anger, but with mild wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all cantankerous cranks he is the worst,&rdquo; he would say with a
      sigh. &ldquo;It is sad to see the temple of friendship tumble down about one&rsquo;s
      ears in this way.&rdquo; At their last talk of this kind Yates resolved not to
      discuss the problem again with the professor, unless a crisis came. The
      crisis came in the form of Stoliker, who dropped in on Yates as the latter
      lay in the hammock, smoking and enjoying a thrilling romance. The camp was
      strewn with these engrossing, paper-covered works, and Yates had read many
      of them, hoping to came across a case similar to his own, but up to the
      time of Stoliker&rsquo;s visit he had not succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Stoliker! how&rsquo;s things? Got the cuffs in your pocket? Want to have
      another tour across country with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I came to warn you. There will be a warrant out to-morrow or next
      day, and, if I were you, I would get over to the other side; though you
      need never say I told you. Of course, if they give the warrant to me, I
      shall have to arrest you; and although nothing may be done to you, still,
      the country is in a state of excitement, and you will at least be put to
      some inconvenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoliker,&rdquo; cried Yates, springing out of the hammock, &ldquo;you are a white
      man! You&rsquo;re a good fellow, Stoliker, and I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged. If you
      ever come to New York, you call on me at the <i>Argus</i> office,&mdash;anybody
      will show you where it is,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll give you the liveliest time you
      ever had in your life. It won&rsquo;t cost you a cent, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;Now, if I were you, I would light
      out to-morrow at the latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Yates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker disappeared quietly among the trees, and Yates, after a moment&rsquo;s
      thought, began energetically to pack up his belongings. It was dark before
      he had finished, and Renmark returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stilly,&rdquo; cried the reporter cheerily, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a warrant out for my
      arrest. I shall have to go to-morrow at the latest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! to jail?&rdquo; cried his horrified friend, his conscience now troubling
      him, as the parting came, for his lack of kindness to an old comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if the court knows herself. But to Buffalo, which is pretty much the
      same thing. Still, thank goodness, I don&rsquo;t need to stay there long. I&rsquo;ll
      be in New York before I&rsquo;m many days older. I yearn to plunge into the
      arena once more. The still, calm peacefulness of this whole vacation has
      made me long for excitement again, and I&rsquo;m glad the warrant has pushed me
      into the turmoil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Richard, I&rsquo;m sorry you have to go under such conditions. I&rsquo;m afraid
      I have not been as companionable a comrade as you should have had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re all right, Renny. The trouble with you is that you have drawn
      a little circle around Toronto University, and said to yourself: &lsquo;This is
      the world.&rsquo; It isn&rsquo;t, you know. There is something outside of all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man, doubtless, has his little circle. Yours is around the <i>Argus</i>
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there are special wires from that little circle to all the rest
      of the world, and soon there will be an Atlantic cable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not hold that my circle is as large as yours; still, there is
      something outside of New York, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your life there is; and, now that you are in a more sympathetic
      frame of mind, it is that I want to talk with you about. Those two girls
      are outside my little circle, and I want to bring one of them within it.
      Now, Renmark, which of those girls would you choose if you were me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor drew in his breath sharply, and was silent for a moment. At
      last he said, speaking slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, Mr. Yates, that you do not quite appreciate my point of
      view. As you may think I have acted in an unfriendly manner, I will try
      for the first and final time to explain it. I hold that any man who
      marries a good woman gets more than he deserves, no matter how worthy he
      may be. I have a profound respect for all women, and I think that your
      light chatter about choosing between two is an insult to both of them. I
      think either of them is infinitely too good for you&mdash;or for me
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do, do you? Perhaps you think that you would make a much better
      husband than I. If that is the case, allow me to say you are entirely
      wrong. If your wife was sensitive, you would kill her with your gloomy
      fits. I wouldn&rsquo;t go off in the woods and sulk, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are referring to me, I will further inform you that I had either
      to go off in the woods or knock you down. I chose the less of two evils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you could do it, I suppose? Renny, you&rsquo;re conceited. You&rsquo;re not the
      first man who has made such a mistake, and found he was barking up the
      wrong tree when it was too late for anything but bandages and arnica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried to show you how I feel regarding this matter. I might have
      known I should not succeed. We will end the discussion, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. The discussion is just beginning. Now, Renny, I&rsquo;ll tell you what
      you need. You need a good, sensible wife worse than any man I know. It is
      not yet too late to save you, but it soon will be. You will, before long,
      grow a crust on you like a snail, or a lobster, or any other cold-blooded
      animal that gets a shell on itself. Then nothing can be done for you. Now,
      let me save you, Renny, before it is too late. Here is my proposition: You
      choose one of those girls and marry her. I&rsquo;ll take the other. I&rsquo;m not as
      unselfish as I may seem in this, for your choice will save me the worry of
      making up my own mind. According to your talk, either of the girls is too
      good for you, and for once I entirely agree with you. But let that pass.
      Now, which one is it to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! man, do you think I am going to bargain with you about my
      future wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Renny. I like to hear you swear. It shows you are not yet
      the prig you would have folks believe. There&rsquo;s still hope for you,
      professor. Now, I&rsquo;ll go further with you. Although I cannot make up my
      mind just what to do myself, I can tell instantly which is the girl for
      you, and thus we solve both problems at one stroke. You need a wife who
      will take you in hand. You need one who will not put up with your
      tantrums, who will be cheerful, and who will make a man of you. Kitty
      Bartlett is the girl. She will tyrannize over you, just as her mother does
      over the old man. She will keep house to the queen&rsquo;s taste, and delight in
      getting you good things to eat. Why, everything is as plain as a
      pikestaff. That shows the benefit of talking over a thing. You marry
      Kitty, and I&rsquo;ll marry Margaret. Come, let&rsquo;s shake hands over it.&rdquo; Yates
      held up his right hand, ready to slap it down on the open palm of the
      professor, but there was no response. Yates&rsquo; hand came down to his side
      again, but he had not yet lost the enthusiasm of his proposal. The more he
      thought of it the more fitting it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret is such a sensible, quiet, level-headed girl that, if I am as
      flippant as you say, she will be just the wife for me. There are depths in
      my character, Renmark, that you have not suspected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit it. Well, a good, sober-minded woman would develop the best that
      is in me. Now, what do you say, Renny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing. I am going into the woods again, dark as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Yates with a sigh, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no doing anything with you or
      for you. I&rsquo;ve tried my best; that is one consolation. Don&rsquo;t go away. I&rsquo;ll
      let fate decide. Here goes for a toss-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Yates drew a silver half dollar from his pocket. &ldquo;Heads for Margaret!&rdquo;
       he cried. Renmark clinched his fist, took a step forward, then checked
      himself, remembering that this was his last night with the man who had at
      least once been his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates merrily spun the coin in the air, caught it in one hand, and slapped
      the other over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the turning point in the lives of two innocent beings.&rdquo; He raised
      the covering hand, and peered at the coin in the gathering gloom. &ldquo;Heads
      it is. Margaret Howard becomes Mrs. Richard Yates. Congratulate me,
      professor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark stood motionless as a statue, an object lesson in self-control.
      Yates set his hat more jauntily on his head, and slipped the epoch-making
      coin into his trousers pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later, and tell you all the
      particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for the answer, for which he probably knew there would
      have been little use in delaying, Yates walked to the fence and sprang
      over it, with one hand on the top rail. Renmark stood still for some
      minutes, then, quietly gathering underbrush and sticks large and small,
      lighted a fire, and sat down on a log, with his head in his hands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yates walked merrily down the road, whistling &ldquo;Gayly the troubadour.&rdquo;
       Perhaps there is no moment in a man&rsquo;s life when he feels the joy of being
      alive more keenly than when he goes to propose to a girl of whose
      favorable answer he is reasonably sure&mdash;unless it be the moment he
      walks away an accepted lover. There is a magic about a June night, with
      its soft, velvety darkness and its sweet, mild air laden with the perfumes
      of wood and field. The enchantment of the hour threw its spell over the
      young man, and he resolved to live a better life, and be worthy of the
      girl he had chosen, or, rather, that fate had chosen for him. He paused a
      moment, leaning over the fence near the Howard homestead, for he had not
      yet settled in his own mind the details of the meeting. He would not go
      in, for in that case he knew he would have to talk, perhaps for hours,
      with everyone but the person he wished to meet. If he announced himself
      and asked to see Margaret alone, his doing so would embarrass her at the
      very beginning. Yates was naturally too much of a diplomat to begin
      awkwardly. As he stood there, wishing chance would bring her out of the
      house, there appeared a light in the door-window of the room where he knew
      the convalescent boy lay. Margaret&rsquo;s shadow formed a silhouette on the
      blind. Yates caught up a handful of sand, and flung it lightly against the
      pane. Its soft patter evidently attracted the attention of the girl, for,
      after a moment&rsquo;s pause, the window opened carefully, while Margaret
      stepped quickly out and closed it, quietly standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; whispered Yates hardly above his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl advanced toward the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that <i>you</i>?&rdquo; she whispered in return, with an accent on the last
      word that thrilled her listener. The accent told plainly as speech that
      the word represented the one man on earth to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Yates, springing over the fence and approaching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Margaret, starting back, then checking herself, with a catch
      in her voice. &ldquo;You&mdash;you startled me&mdash;Mr. Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Mr. Yates any more, Margaret, but Dick. Margaret, I wanted to see you
      alone. You know why I have come.&rdquo; He tried to grasp both her hands, but
      she put them resolutely behind her, seemingly wishing to retreat, yet
      standing her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, you must have seen long ago how it is with me. I love you,
      Margaret, loyally and truly. It seems as if I had loved you all my life. I
      certainly have since the first day I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Yates, you must not talk to me like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, how else <i>can</i> I talk to you? It cannot be a surprise to
      you, Margaret. You must have known it long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not, indeed I did not&mdash;if you really mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean it? I never meant anything as I mean this. It is everything to me,
      and nothing else is anything. I have knocked about the world a good deal,
      I admit, but I never was in love before&mdash;never knew what love was
      until I met you. I tell you that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please, Mr. Yates, do not say anything more. If it is really
      true, I cannot tell you how sorry I am. I hope nothing I have said or done
      has made you believe that&mdash;that&mdash;Oh, I do not know what to say!
      I never thought you could be in earnest about anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely cannot have so misjudged me, Margaret. Others have, but I did
      not expect it of you. You are far and away better than I am. No one knows
      that so well as I. I do not pretend to be worthy of you, but I will be a
      devoted husband to you. Any man who gets the love of a good woman,&rdquo;
       continued Yates earnestly, plagiarizing Renmark, &ldquo;gets more than he
      deserves; but surely such love as mine is not given merely to be
      scornfully trampled underfoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not treat your&mdash;you scornfully. I am only sorry if what you say
      is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say <i>if</i> it is true? Don&rsquo;t you know it is true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am very sorry&mdash;very, <i>very</i> sorry, and I hope it is
      through no fault of mine. But you will soon forget me. When you return to
      New York&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; said the young man bitterly, &ldquo;I shall never forget you. Think
      what you are doing before it is too late. Think how much this means to me.
      If you finally refuse me, you will wreck my life. I am the sort of man
      that a woman can make or mar. Do not, I beg of you, ruin the life of the
      man who loves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a missionary,&rdquo; cried Margaret with sudden anger. &ldquo;If your life
      is to be wrecked, it will be through your own foolishness, and not from
      any act of mine. I think it cowardly of you to say that I am to be held
      responsible. I have no wish to influence your future one way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for good, Margaret?&rdquo; asked Yates with tender reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. A man whose good or bad conduct depends on anyone but himself is not
      my ideal of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what your ideal is, so that I may try to attain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it will be useless for me to try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I am concerned, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, I want to ask you one more question. I have no right to, but I
      beg you to answer me. Are you in love with anyone else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Margaret hotly. &ldquo;How dare you ask me such a question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is not a crime&mdash;that is, being in love with someone else is
      not. I&rsquo;ll tell you why I dare ask. I swear, by all the gods, that I shall
      win you&mdash;if not this year, then next; and if not next, then the year
      after. I was a coward to talk as I did; but I love you more now than I did
      even then. All I want to know is that you are not in love with another
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are very cruel in persisting as you do, when you have had
      your answer. I say no. Never! never! never!&mdash;this year nor any other
      year. Is not that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me. A woman&rsquo;s &lsquo;no&rsquo; may ultimately mean &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Mr. Yates,&rdquo; replied Margaret, drawing herself up as one who
      makes a final plunge. &ldquo;You remember the question you asked me just now?&mdash;whether
      I cared for anyone else? I said &lsquo;no.&rsquo; That &lsquo;no&rsquo; meant &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was standing between her and the window, so she could not escape by the
      way she came. He saw she meditated flight, and made as though he would
      intercept her, but she was too quick for him. She ran around the house,
      and he heard a door open and shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew he was defeated. Dejectedly he turned to the fence, climbing
      slowly over where he had leaped so lightly a few minutes before, and
      walked down the road, cursing his fate. Although he admitted he was a
      coward for talking to her as he had done about his wrecked life, yet he
      knew now that every word he had spoken was true. What did the future hold
      out to him? Not even the incentive to live. He found himself walking
      toward the tent, but, not wishing to meet Renmark in his present frame of
      mind, he turned and came out on the Ridge Road. He was tired and broken,
      and resolved to stay in camp until they arrested him. Then perhaps she
      might have some pity on him. Who was the other man she loved? or had she
      merely said that to give finality to her refusal? In his present mood he
      pictured the worst, and imagined her the wife of some neighboring farmer&mdash;perhaps
      even of Stoliker. These country girls, he said to himself, never believed
      a man was worth looking at unless he owned a farm. He would save his
      money, and buy up the whole neighborhood; <i>then</i> she would realize
      what she had missed. He climbed up on the fence beside the road, and sat
      on the top rail, with his heels resting on a lower one, so that he might
      enjoy his misery without the fatigue of walking. His vivid imagination
      pictured himself as the owner in a few years&rsquo; time of a large section of
      that part of the country, with mortgages on a good deal of the remainder,
      including the farm owned by Margaret&rsquo;s husband. He saw her now, a farmer&rsquo;s
      faded wife, coming to him and begging for further time in which to pay the
      seven per cent. due. He knew he would act magnanimously on such an
      occasion, and grandly give her husband all the time he required. Perhaps
      then she would realize the mistake she had made. Or perhaps fame, rather
      than riches, would be his line. His name would ring throughout the land.
      He might become a great politician, and bankrupt Canada with a rigid
      tariff law. The unfairness of making the whole innocent people suffer for
      the inconsiderate act of one of them did not occur to him at the moment,
      for he was humiliated and hurt. There is no bitterness like that which
      assails the man who has been rejected by the girl he adores&mdash;while it
      lasts. His eye wandered toward the black mass of the Howard house. It was
      as dark as his thoughts. He turned his head slowly around, and, like a
      bright star of hope, there glimmered up the road a flickering light from
      the Bartletts&rsquo; parlor window. Although time had stopped as far as he was
      concerned, he was convinced it could not be very late, or the Bartletts
      would have gone to bed. It is always difficult to realize that the
      greatest of catastrophes are generally over in a few minutes. It seemed an
      age since he walked so hopefully away from the tent. As he looked at the
      light the thought struck him that perhaps Kitty was alone in the parlor.
      She at least would not have treated him so badly as the other girl; and&mdash;and
      she was pretty, too, come to think of it. He always did like a blonde
      better than a brunette.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fence rail is not a comfortable seat. It is used in some parts of the
      country in such a manner as to impress the sitter with the fact of its
      extreme discomfort, and as a gentle hint that his presence is not wanted
      in that immediate neighborhood. Yates recollected this, with a smile, as
      he slid off and stumbled into the ditch by the side of the road. His mind
      had been so preoccupied that he had forgotten about the ditch. As he
      walked along the road toward the star that guided him he remembered he had
      recklessly offered Miss Kitty to the callous professor. After all, no one
      knew about the episode of a short time before except himself and Margaret,
      and he felt convinced she was not a girl to boast of her conquests.
      Anyhow, it didn&rsquo;t matter. A man is surely master of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he neared the window he looked in. People are not particular about
      lowering the blinds in the country. He was rather disappointed to see Mrs.
      Bartlett sitting there knitting, like the industrious woman she was. Still
      it was consoling to note that none of the men-folks were present, and that
      Kitty, with her fluffy hair half concealing her face, sat reading a book
      he had lent to her. He rapped at the door, and it was opened by Mrs.
      Bartlett, with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake! is that you, Mr. Yates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right in. Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? You look as if you had
      lost your best friend. Ah, I see how it is,&rdquo;&mdash;Yates started,&mdash;&ldquo;you
      have run out of provisions, and are very likely as hungry as a bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it first time, Mrs. Bartlett. I dropped around to see if I
      could borrow a loaf of bread. We don&rsquo;t bake till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bartlett laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice baking you would do if you tried it. I&rsquo;ll get you a loaf in a
      minute. Are you sure one is enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite enough, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good woman bustled out to the other room for the loaf, and Yates made
      good use of her temporary absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I want to see you alone for a few minutes. I&rsquo;ll
      wait for you at the gate. Can you slip out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty blushed very red and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have a warrant out for my arrest, and I&rsquo;m off to-morrow before they
      can serve it. But I couldn&rsquo;t go without seeing you. You&rsquo;ll come, sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Kitty nodded, after looking up at him in alarm when he spoke of the
      warrant. Before anything further could be said Mrs. Bartlett came in, and
      Kitty was absorbed in her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have something to eat now before you go back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Bartlett. You see, the professor is waiting for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him wait, if he didn&rsquo;t have sense enough to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t. I offered him the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take us a moment to set the table. It is not the least trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Bartlett, you are very kind. I am not in the slightest
      degree hungry now. I am merely taking some thought of the morrow. No; I
      must be going, and thank you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bartlett, seeing him to the door, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s anything
      you want, come to me, and I will let you have it if it&rsquo;s in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good to me,&rdquo; said the young man with genuine feeling, &ldquo;and I
      don&rsquo;t deserve it; but I may remind you of your promise&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that you do,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates waited at the gate, placing the loaf on the post, where he forgot
      it, much to the astonishment of the donor in the morning. He did not have
      to wait long, for Kitty came around the house somewhat shrinkingly, as one
      who was doing the most wicked thing that had been done since the world
      began. Yates hastened to meet her, clasping one of her unresisting hands
      in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be off to-morrow,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; answered Kitty in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Kitty, you are not half so sorry as I am. But I intend to come back,
      if you will let me. Kitty, you remember that talk we had in the kitchen,
      when we&mdash;when there was an interruption, and when I had to go away
      with our friend Stoliker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty indicated that she remembered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course you know what I wanted to say to you. Of course you know
      what I want to say to you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, however, that in this he was mistaken, for Kitty had not the
      slightest idea, and wanted to go into the house, for it was late, and her
      mother would miss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, you darling little humbug, you know that I love you. You must know
      that I have loved you ever since the first day I saw you, when you laughed
      at me. Kitty, I want you to marry me and make something of me, if that is
      possible. I am a worthless fellow, not half good enough for a little pet
      like you; but, Kitty, if you will only say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; I will try, and try
      hard, to be a better man than I have ever been before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty did not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but she placed her disengaged hand, warm and soft,
      upon his, and Yates was not the man to have any hesitation about what to
      do next. To practical people it may seem an astonishing thing that, the
      object of the interview being happily accomplished, there should be any
      need of prolonging it; yet the two lingered there, and he told her much of
      his past life, and of how lonely and sordid it had been because he had no
      one to care for him&mdash;at which her pretty eyes filled with tears. She
      felt proud and happy to think she had won the first great love of a
      talented man&rsquo;s life, and hoped she would make him happy, and in a measure
      atone for the emptiness of the life that had gone before. She prayed that
      he might always be as fond of her as he was then, and resolved to be
      worthy of him if she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, her wishes have been amply fulfilled, and few wives are as
      happy or as proud of their husbands as Kitty Yates. The one woman who
      might have put the drop of bitterness in her cup of life merely kissed her
      tenderly when Kitty told her of the great joy that had come to her, and
      said she was sure she would be happy; and thus for the second time
      Margaret told the thing that was not, but for once Margaret was wrong in
      her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates walked to the tent a glorified man, leaving his loaf on the gatepost
      behind him. Few realize that it is quite as pleasant to be loved as to
      love. The verb &ldquo;to love&rdquo; has many conjugations. The earth he trod was like
      no other ground he had ever walked upon. The magic of the June night was
      never so enchanting before. He strode along with his head and his thoughts
      in the clouds, and the Providence that cares for the intoxicated looked
      after him, and saw that the accepted lover came to no harm. He leaped the
      fence without even putting his hand to it, and then was brought to earth
      again by the picture of a man sitting with his head in his hands beside a
      dying fire.

      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yates stood for a moment regarding the dejected attitude of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, old man!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you have the most &lsquo;hark-from-the-tombs&rsquo; 
      appearance I ever saw. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s I. Been expecting anybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have been waiting for you, and thinking of a variety of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look it. Well, Renny, congratulate me, my boy. She&rsquo;s mine, and I&rsquo;m
      hers&mdash;which are two ways of stating the same delightful fact. I&rsquo;m up
      in a balloon, Renny. I&rsquo;m engaged to the prettiest, sweetest, and most
      delightful girl there is from the Atlantic to the Pacific. What d&rsquo;ye think
      of that? Say, Renmark, there&rsquo;s nothing on earth like it. You ought to
      reform and go in for being in love. It would make a man of you. Champagne
      isn&rsquo;t to be compared to it. Get up here and dance, and don&rsquo;t sit there
      like a bear nursing a sore paw. Do you comprehend that I am to be married
      to the darlingest girl that lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say. Every day of her life, bless her! But I don&rsquo;t say it
      quite in that tone, Renmark. What&rsquo;s the matter with you? One would think
      you were in love with the girl yourself, if such a thing were possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it not possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is a conundrum, I can answer it the first time. Because you are a
      fossil. You are too good, Renny; therefore dull and uninteresting. Now,
      there is nothing a woman likes so much as to reclaim a man. It always
      annoys a woman to know that the man she is interested in has a past with
      which she has had nothing to do. If he is wicked and she can sort of make
      him over, like an old dress, she revels in the process. She flatters
      herself she makes a new man of him, and thinks she owns that new man by
      right of manufacture. We owe it to the sex, Renny, to give &lsquo;em a chance at
      reforming us. I have known men who hated tobacco take to smoking merely to
      give it up joyfully for the sake of the women they loved. Now, if a man is
      perfect to begin with, what is a dear, ministering angel of a woman to do
      with him? Manifestly nothing. The trouble with you, Renny, is that you are
      too evidently ruled by a good and well-trained conscience, and naturally
      all women you meet intuitively see this, and have no use for you. A little
      wickedness would be the making of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, that if a man&rsquo;s impulse is to do what his conscience
      tells him is wrong, he should follow his impulse, and not his conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You state the case with unnecessary seriousness. I believe that an
      occasional blow-out is good for a man. But if you ever have an impulse of
      that kind, I think you should give way to it for once, just to see how it
      feels. A man who is too good gets conceited about himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I half believe you are right, Mr. Yates,&rdquo; said the professor, rising. &ldquo;I
      will act on your advice, and, as you put it, see how it feels. My
      conscience tells me that I should congratulate you, and wish you a long
      and happy life with the girl you have&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say chosen, but tossed
      up for. The natural man in me, on the other hand, urges me to break every
      bone in your worthless body. Throw off your coat, Yates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Renmark, you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. Be all the more on your guard, if you believe it. A lunatic
      is sometimes dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go away. You&rsquo;re dreaming. You&rsquo;re talking in your sleep. What! Fight?
      Tonight? Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to strike you before you are ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Renny, no. My wants are always modest. I don&rsquo;t wish to fight at all,
      especially to-night. I&rsquo;m a reformed man, I tell you. I have no desire to
      bid good-by to my best girl with a black eye to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then stop talking, if you can, and defend yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to fight here in the dark. Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself for a
      moment that I am afraid. You just spar with yourself and get limbered up,
      while I put some wood on the fire. This is too ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates gathered some fuel, and managed to coax the dying embers into a
      blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s better. Now, let me have a look at you. In the
      name of wonder, Renny, what do you want to fight me for to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to give my reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I refuse to fight. I&rsquo;ll run, and I can beat you in a foot race any
      day in the week. Why, you&rsquo;re worse than her father. He at least let me
      know why he fought me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty&rsquo;s father, of course&mdash;my future father-in-law. And that&rsquo;s
      another ordeal ahead of me. I haven&rsquo;t spoken to the old man yet, and I
      need all my fighting grit for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t my language plain? It usually is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom are you engaged? As I understand your talk, it is to Miss
      Bartlett. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right as rain, Renny. This fire is dying down again. Say, can&rsquo;t we
      postpone our fracas until daylight? I don&rsquo;t want to gather any more wood.
      Besides, one of us is sure to be knocked into the fire, and thus ruin
      whatever is left of our clothes. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say? I say I am an idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! reason is returning, Renny. I perfectly agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Then you did not propose to Mar&mdash;to Miss Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you touch upon a sore spot, Renmark, that I am trying to forget. You
      remember the unfortunate toss-up; in fact, I think you referred to it a
      moment ago, and you were justly indignant about it at the time. Well, I
      don&rsquo;t care to talk much about the sequel; but, as you know the beginning,
      you will have to know the end, because I want to wring a sacred promise
      from you. You are never to mention this episode of the toss-up, or of my
      confession, to any living soul. The telling of it might do harm, and it
      couldn&rsquo;t possibly do any good. Will you promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. But do not tell me unless you wish to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly yearn to talk about it, but it is better you should
      understand how the land lies, so you won&rsquo;t make any mistake. Not on <i>my</i>
      account, you know, but I would not like it to come to Kitty&rsquo;s ears. Yes, I
      proposed to Margaret&mdash;first. She wouldn&rsquo;t look at me. Can you credit
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now that you mention it, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I see you <i>can</i> credit it. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t at first; but
      Margaret knows her own mind, there&rsquo;s no question about <i>that</i>. Say!
      she&rsquo;s in love with some other fellow. I found out that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked her, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s my profession to find out things; and, naturally, if I do that
      for my paper, it is not likely I am going to be behindhand when it comes
      to myself. She denied it at first, but admitted it afterward, and then
      bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have used great tact and delicacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Renmark; I&rsquo;m not going to stand any of your sneering. I told
      you this was a sore subject with me. I&rsquo;m not telling you because I like
      to, but because I have to. Don&rsquo;t put me in fighting humor, Mr. Renmark. If
      <i>I</i> talk fight, I won&rsquo;t begin for no reason and then back out for no
      reason. I&rsquo;ll go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be discreet, and beg to take back all I said. What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else. Isn&rsquo;t that enough? It was more than enough for me&mdash;at
      the time. I tell you, Renmark, I spent a pretty bad half hour sitting on
      the fence and thinking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yates rose from the fire indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take that back, too,&rdquo; cried the professor hastily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me you&rsquo;ve become awfully funny all of a sudden. Don&rsquo;t you
      think it&rsquo;s about time we took to our bunks? It&rsquo;s late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark agreed with him but did not turn in. He walked to the friendly
      fence, laid his arms along the top rail, and gazed at the friendly stars.
      He had not noticed before how lovely the night was, with its impressive
      stillness, as if the world had stopped, as a steamer stops in mid-ocean.
      After quieting his troubled spirit with the restful stars he climbed the
      fence and walked down the road, taking little heed of the direction. The
      still night was a soothing companion. He came at last to a sleeping
      village of wooden houses, and through the center of the town ran a single
      line of rails, an iron link connecting the unknown hamlet with all
      civilization. A red and a green light glimmered down the line, giving the
      only indication that a train ever came that way. As he went a mile or two
      farther the cool breath of the great lake made itself felt, and after
      crossing a field he suddenly came upon the water, finding all further
      progress in that direction barred. Huge sand dunes formed the shore,
      covered with sighing pines. At the foot of the dunes stretched a broad
      beach of firm sand, dimly visible in contrast with the darker water; and
      at long intervals fell the light ripple of the languid summer waves,
      running up the beach with a half-asleep whisper, that became softer and
      softer until it was merged in the silence beyond. Far out on the dark
      waters a point of light, like a floating star, showed where a steamer was
      slowly making her way; and so still was the night that he felt rather than
      heard her pulsating engines. It was the only sign of life visible from
      that enchanted bay&mdash;the bay of the silver beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark threw himself down on the soft sand at the foot of a dune. The
      point of light gradually worked its way to the west, following, doubtless
      unconsciously, the star of empire, and disappeared around the headland,
      taking with it a certain vague sense of companionship. But the world is
      very small, and a man is never quite as much alone as he thinks he is.
      Renmark heard the low hoot of an owl among the trees, which cry he was
      astonished to hear answered from the water. He sat up and listened.
      Presently there grated on the sand the keel of a boat, and someone stepped
      ashore. From the woods there emerged the shadowy forms of three men.
      Nothing was said, but they got silently into the boat, which might have
      been Charon&rsquo;s craft for all he could see of it. The rattle of the rowlocks
      and the plash of oars followed, while a voice cautioned the rowers to make
      less noise. It was evident that some belated fugitives were eluding the
      authorities of both countries. Renmark thought, with a smile, that if
      Yates were in his place he would at least give them a fright. A sharp
      command to an imaginary company to load and fire would travel far on such
      a night, and would give the rowers a few moments of great discomfort.
      Renmark, however, did not shout, but treated the episode as part of the
      mystical dream, and lay down on the sand again. He noticed that the water
      in the east seemed to feel the approach of morning even before the sky.
      Gradually the day dawned, a slowly lightening gray at first, until the
      coming sun spattered a filmy cloud with gold and crimson. Renmark watched
      the glory of the sunrise, took one lingering look at the curved beauty of
      the bay shore, shook the sand from his clothing, and started back for the
      village and the camp beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village was astir when he reached it. He was surprised to see Stoliker
      on horseback in front of one of the taverns. Two assistants were with him,
      also seated on horses. The constable seemed disturbed by the sight of
      Renmark, but he was there to do his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re up early. I have a warrant for the arrest of
      your friend: I suppose you won&rsquo;t tell me where he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect me to give any information that will get a friend into
      trouble, can you? especially as he has done nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may turn out before a jury,&rdquo; said one of the assistants
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented, Stoliker, winking quietly at the professor. &ldquo;That is for
      judge and jury to determine&mdash;not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Renmark, &ldquo;I will not inform about anybody, unless I am
      compelled to do so, but I may save you some trouble by telling where I
      have been and what I have seen. I am on my way back from the lake. If you
      go down there, you will still see the mark of a boat&rsquo;s keel on the sand,
      and probably footprints. A boat came over from the other shore in the
      night, and a man got on board. I don&rsquo;t say who the man was, and I had
      nothing to do with the matter in any way except as a spectator. That is
      all the information I have to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoliker turned to his assistants, and nodded. &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; he
      asked. &ldquo;We were right on his track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said the railroad,&rdquo; grumbled the man who had spoken before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we were within two miles of him. Let us go down to the lake and see
      the traces. Then we can return the warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Renmark found Yates still asleep in the tent. He prepared breakfast
      without disturbing him. When the meal was ready, he roused the reporter
      and told him of his meeting with Stoliker, advising him to get back to New
      York without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yates yawned sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming it all out. I&rsquo;ll get father-in-law to
      tote me out to Fort Erie to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it will be safe to put it off so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safer than trying to get away during the day. After breakfast I&rsquo;m going
      down to the Bartlett homestead. Must have a talk with the old folks, you
      know. I&rsquo;ll spend the rest of the day making up for that interview by
      talking with Kitty. Stoliker will never search for me there, and, now that
      he thinks I&rsquo;m gone, he will likely make a visit to the tent. Stoliker is a
      good fellow, but his strong point is duty, you know; and if he&rsquo;s certain
      I&rsquo;m gone, he&rsquo;ll give his country the worth of its money by searching. I
      won&rsquo;t be back for dinner, so you can put in your time reading my Dime
      Novels. I make no reflections on your cooking, Renny, now that the
      vacation is over; but I have my preferences, and they incline toward a
      final meal with the Bartletts. If I were you, I&rsquo;d have a nap. You look
      tired out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renmark intended to lie down for a few moments until Yates was clear of
      the camp, after which he determined to pay a visit; but Nature, when she
      got him locked up in sleep, took her revenge. He did not hear Stoliker and
      his satellites search the premises, just as Yates had predicted they
      would; and when he finally awoke, he found to his astonishment that it was
      nearly dark. But he was all the better for his sleep, and he attended to
      his personal appearance with more than ordinary care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hiram Bartlett accepted the situation with the patient and grim
      stolidity of a man who takes a blow dealt him by a Providence known by him
      to be inscrutable. What he had done to deserve it was beyond his
      comprehension. He silently hitched up his horses, and, for the first time
      in his life, drove into Fort Erie without any reasonable excuse for going
      there. He tied his team at the usual corner, after which he sat at one of
      the taverns and drank strong waters that had no apparent effect on him. He
      even went so far as to smoke two native cigars; and a man who can do that
      can do anything. To bring up a daughter who would deliberately accept a
      man from &ldquo;the States,&rdquo; and to have a wife who would aid and abet such an
      action, giving comfort and support to the enemy, seemed to him traitorous
      to all the traditions of 1812, or any other date in the history of the two
      countries. At times wild ideas of getting blind full, and going home to
      break every breakable thing in the house, rose in his mind; but prudence
      whispered that he had to live all the rest of his life with his wife, and
      he realized that this scheme of vengeance had its drawbacks. Finally, he
      untied his patient team, after paying his bill, and drove silently home,
      not having returned, even by a nod, any of the salutations tendered to him
      that day. He was somewhat relieved to find no questions were asked, and
      that his wife recognized the fact that he was passing through a crisis.
      Nevertheless, there was a steely glitter in her eye under which he
      uneasily quailed, for it told him a line had been reached which it would
      not be well for him to cross. She forgave, but it must not go any further.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Yates kissed Kitty good-night at the gate, he asked her, with some
      trepidation, whether she had told anyone of their engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one but Margaret,&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo; asked Yates, as if, after all, her opinion was of
      no importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said she was sure I should be happy, and she knew you would make a
      good husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather a nice girl, is Margaret,&rdquo; remarked Yates, with the air of a
      man willing to concede good qualities to a girl other than his own, but
      indicating, after all, that there was but one on earth for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a lovely girl,&rdquo; said Kitty enthusiastically. &ldquo;I wonder, Dick, when
      you knew her, why you ever fell in love with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea! I haven&rsquo;t a word to say against Margaret; but, compared with my
      girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he finished his sentence with a practical illustration of his frame of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked alone down the road he reflected that Margaret had acted very
      handsomely, and he resolved to drop in and wish her good-by. But as he
      approached the house his courage began to fail him, and he thought it
      better to sit on the fence, near the place where he had sat the night
      before, and think it over. It took a good deal of thinking. But as he sat
      there it was destined that Yates should receive some information which
      would simplify matters. Two persons came slowly out of the gate in the
      gathering darkness. They strolled together up the road past him, absorbed
      in themselves. When directly opposite the reporter, Renmark put his arm
      around Margaret&rsquo;s waist, and Yates nearly fell off the fence. He held his
      breath until they were safely out of hearing, then slid down and crawled
      along in the shadow until he came to the side road, up which he walked,
      thoughtfully pausing every few moments to remark: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       But speech seemed to have failed him; he could get no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at the fence and leaned against it, gazing for the last time at
      the tent, glimmering white, like a misshapen ghost, among the somber
      trees. He had no energy left to climb over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a chimpanzee,&rdquo; he muttered to himself at last. &ldquo;The highest
      bidder can have me, with no upset price. Dick Yates, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      believed it of you. <i>You</i> a newspaper man? <i>You</i> a reporter from
      &lsquo;way back? <i>You</i> up to snuff? Yates, I&rsquo;m ashamed to be seen in your
      company! Go back to New York, and let the youngest reporter in from a
      country newspaper scoop the daylight out of you. To think that this thing
      has been going on right under your well-developed nose, and you never saw
      it&mdash;worse, never had the faintest suspicion of it; that it was thrust
      at you twenty times a day&mdash;nearly got your stupid head smashed on
      account of it; yet you bleated away like the innocent little lamb that you
      are, and never even suspected! Dick, you&rsquo;re a three-sheet-poster fool in
      colored ink. And to think that both of them know all about the first
      proposal! <i>Both</i> of them! Well, thank Heaven, Toronto is a long way
      from New York.&rdquo;
     </p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
